# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->
</tool_name>

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/02-workspace-default-folders.md:

<content lines="1-50">
 1 | ive been thinking about how we will work with mode context and custom instructions and i think it is becoming apparent to me that we have created far to much custom instruction context for each mode and that we might want to shift from monolithic updates to the modes contexts to just ongoing improvements.
 2 | 
 3 | so for example,
 4 | 
 5 | what if we have a root .mode folder
 6 | and we dont nest the modes, we just name them as folders of the mode names, eg
 7 | .mode/accessibility-specialist
 8 | .mode/angular-developer
 9 | .mode/animejs-specialist
10 | etc
11 | 
12 | and whatever we put in there can be potentially looked up by the mode when it is doing some work, it could check its readme in its custom-instructions folder eg
13 | .modes/angular-developer/custom-instructions/README.md
14 | except we change the custom-instructions to be 'kb'
15 | so it would be
16 | .modes/angular-developer/kb/README.md
17 | which is more efficient and more meaningful for what is in there
18 | and we can keep the context and examples folders, the user might put things there or we might in the future
19 | so anyway the mode would decide when its checked the readme if any of the files in the /kb are going to be helpful for its assigned task and if it thinks so it would read the relevant ones into its context
20 | and that could be a workspace level .roo/rules because that same rule would work fine for any mode, almost like before beginning work it checks its knowledgebase to see if it has something useful
21 | 
22 | i think we should revise the naming conventions for the modes eg
23 | 
24 | roo-commander
25 | manager-projects
26 | manager-products
27 | lead-backend
28 | lead-design
29 | dev-angular
30 | dev-tailwind
31 | dev-react
32 | dev-jquery
33 | design-ui
34 | design-mui
35 | design-shadcn
36 | etc
37 | 
38 | and i would like us to try harder to not use the same emoji for more than one mode, so start with roo commander, it gets the crown, and then we go to the manager level, pick the most appropriate emoji, and one by one we check the mode and decide on an emoji and if its taken we pick something else
39 | 
40 | that actually feels and reads kind of naturally to me, and i think with shorter names its less cluttered and dispenses with all the words like specialist and developer that take up so much character usage.
41 | 
42 | and i think we dont even need the footgun modes but we can have mode folders for the default modes like
43 | .mode/code
44 | .mode/debug
45 | .mode/ask
46 | .mode/architect
47 | and the sub folders for each, context, kb, examples
48 | in case we want to have some custom context for those modes
49 | 
50 | what do you think? what would you do differently? any problems with this ideas?

        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml

**Assistant:**

Thank you for sharing your thoughts on reorganizing the mode sources and conventions. This is a valuable discussion for improving the maintainability and efficiency of the Roo mode system. I've reviewed your proposals outlined in `.docs/notes/changing-the-organising-of-mode-sources.md`.

Here's my assessment of your ideas:

1.  **Problem Statement & Goal:** I agree that the current custom instruction context for some modes might be overly large and monolithic. Shifting towards a more dynamic, knowledge-base-driven approach where modes pull relevant context as needed is a sound strategic direction. It aligns with goals of efficiency and ongoing improvement.

2.  **Proposed Structure (`.mode/<mode-slug>/`):**
    *   **Pros:** A flat structure under a single `.mode` directory offers simplicity for navigation and potentially for scripting operations across modes. Renaming `custom-instructions` to `kb` (knowledge base) is more intuitive and concise. Keeping `context` and `examples` provides flexibility.
    *   **Cons/Considerations:**
        *   **Scalability:** With a large number of modes, a flat structure could become difficult to browse.
        *   **Versioning/Grouping:** The current `vX.Y/modes/` structure provides inherent versioning and grouping. How would we manage mode versions or logical groupings (e.g., frontend, backend, utility) in a flat structure? We might need a separate manifest file (e.g., `.mode/manifest.toml`) to track mode metadata, versions, and relationships.
        *   **Discoverability:** How would users or the system easily find modes related to a specific domain (e.g., all database modes)? Again, a manifest or clear naming convention becomes crucial.

3.  **Dynamic KB Loading:**
    *   **Pros:** Loading only relevant KB articles on demand could significantly reduce the initial context size, potentially improving performance and reducing costs. It allows for a more granular and targeted knowledge base.
    *   **Cons/Considerations:**
        *   **Mechanism:** The core challenge is *how* a mode determines which KB files are relevant for a given task. This requires a well-defined mechanism. Will it be based on keywords in the task? A predefined index in `kb/README.md`? Will the mode itself need sophisticated logic, or will the underlying system handle KB retrieval? This needs careful design to be effective and reliable.
        *   **Consistency:** Ensuring modes consistently load the *right* context is critical. A poorly implemented system could lead to modes lacking necessary information.
        *   **Rule Implementation:** A global rule prompting modes to check their KB is feasible, but the *selection* logic might need more sophistication.

4.  **New Naming Convention (e.g., `manager-projects`, `dev-angular`):**
    *   **Pros:** The proposed `role-topic` or `area-specialty` convention is shorter, cleaner, and removes redundancy like "specialist" or "developer". It establishes a clearer hierarchy.
    *   **Cons/Considerations:**
        *   **Effort:** This is a significant refactoring. It requires renaming potentially hundreds of mode folders and updating all references (in mode definitions, workflows, documentation, potentially user configurations or habits).
        *   **Clarity:** We need a well-defined and consistently applied set of prefixes (e.g., `core-`, `manager-`, `lead-`, `dev-`, `design-`, `data-`, `test-`, `infra-`, `util-`).
        *   **Mapping:** A clear mapping from old names to new names would be essential during transition.

5.  **Unique Emojis:**
    *   **Pros:** Improves visual distinction and personality.
    *   **Cons:** A lower-priority task. Can be challenging to find unique, appropriate emojis for many modes.

6.  **Default Mode Folders (`.mode/code`, `.mode/ask`):**
    *   **Pros:** Provides a consistent mechanism for potentially customizing even the core modes with specific KB articles or examples.
    *   **Cons:** Might add structure that isn't frequently used.

7.  **Removing Footgun Modes:**
    *   **Pros:** Simplifies the available mode list.
    *   **Cons:** Depends on whether they serve any niche purpose currently. If unused, removal makes sense.

**Summary & Recommendations:**

*   **Overall Direction:** The move towards a more dynamic, KB-driven context and a cleaner structure/naming convention is positive.
*   **Structure:** The flat `.mode` structure is viable but needs a solution for versioning/grouping (perhaps a manifest file).
*   **Naming:** The new naming convention is promising but represents a large refactoring effort that needs careful planning and execution. Defining the standard prefixes is key.
*   **KB Loading:** This has high potential but also the highest technical complexity in implementation. Defining the relevance/retrieval mechanism is critical.
*   **Phased Approach:** Given the scope, I recommend a phased approach:
    1.  **Define Standards:** Finalize the new naming convention (prefixes, structure) and the KB loading mechanism conceptually. Document these decisions (perhaps in an ADR).
    2.  **Pilot Project:** Implement the changes for a small subset of modes (e.g., one functional group like 'backend' or 'data') to test the structure, naming, and KB loading.
    3.  **Refactor:** Based on the pilot, proceed with the broader refactoring of mode names and structure.
    4.  **Implement KB Loading:** Develop and integrate the dynamic KB loading mechanism.
    5.  **Emojis/Default Folders:** Address these as lower-priority enhancements.

**Potential Problems:**

*   **Refactoring Risk:** Renaming and restructuring carry risks of breaking dependencies or introducing inconsistencies if not managed carefully.
*   **KB Logic Complexity:** Designing a robust and efficient KB relevance and loading mechanism is non-trivial.
*   **Tooling Updates:** Any tools that rely on the current structure or naming conventions will need updates.

This is a significant architectural change. I recommend we create a formal proposal or ADR (Architecture Decision Record) in the `.decisions/` folder to document the chosen path, rationale, and implementation plan before starting the work.

What are your thoughts on this assessment and the proposed phased approach?

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->

 1 | Q: How would we manage mode versions or logical groupings (e.g., frontend, backend, utility) in a flat structure? We might need a separate manifest file (e.g., .mode/manifest.toml) to track mode metadata, versions, and relationships.
 2 | 
 3 | A: we will make a manifest file, and that will be part of the information availble to all the modes to lookup and each mode will have a subset of that as part of their context so they know who they are usually delegating to and if its a multi agent workflow or task then they can lookup the sub agents from the manifest and work out what agents are going to likely be required. Clear naming will be helpful. also i forsee that some time in the future be in a database, so by doing it this way it will not be so difficult to transition to that. also it lets us include in the readme file some external links that the mode could consult if it wants to as well.
 4 | 
 5 | Q: Mechanism: The core challenge is how a mode determines which KB files are relevant for a given task. This requires a well-defined mechanism. Will it be based on keywords in the task? A predefined index in kb/README.md? Will the mode itself need sophisticated logic, or will the underlying system handle KB retrieval? This needs careful design to be effective and reliable.
 6 | 
 7 | A: I agree, and i think that this is where we work out a clever prompt that lets the mode self assess based on what it has been asked to do as to what part of its kb would be helpful. It should still be able to fuinction even without kb input but its about increasing its specific knowledge to help keep it focused, and also there could be new information not in its training data for example. it cant be rigid rules, we will need to give the most independence to decide based on some factors you can work out a good prompt.
 8 | 
 9 | Q: We need a well-defined and consistently applied set of prefixes (e.g., core-, manager-, lead-, dev-, design-, data-, test-, infra-, util-).
10 | 
11 | A: i agree, lets discuss this in more detail and be confident, your suggestions sound ok to me, and i think actually even that short word helps with the context for the ai and human as to what the mode is for
12 | 
13 | 
14 | Q: This is a significant architectural change. I recommend we create a formal proposal or ADR (Architecture Decision Record) in the .decisions/ folder to document the chosen path, rationale, and implementation plan before starting the work.
15 | 
16 | A: absolutely, there is no rush, we should plan this out very carefully.
17 | 
18 | 
19 | What else should we consider if anything?

# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here

**Assistant:**

Okay, I have read your answers in `.docs/notes/changing-the-organising-of-mode-sources-qna.md`.

Based on your responses, we have agreement on:
1.  Creating a `.mode/manifest.toml` file for metadata, versioning, and relationships.
2.  Developing a prompt-based mechanism for modes to self-assess Knowledge Base (KB) relevance.
3.  Proceeding carefully by creating an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) first.
4.  Further discussing and finalizing the naming convention prefixes.

The next logical step is to start drafting the ADR. According to the workspace rules (`.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md`), I need to check for an existing ADR template in `.templates/toml-md/README.md`.

I will now read the template README to find the appropriate ADR template file.

  1 | # TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Templates
  2 | 
  3 | This directory contains standardized templates for various document types used within this workspace. These templates leverage the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format, combining structured TOML frontmatter for machine-readable metadata with flexible Markdown for human-readable content.
  4 | 
  5 | ## Purpose & Rationale
  6 | 
  7 | The TOML MD format is used across the workspace (including but not limited to MDTM task files, ADRs, documentation, context sources, meeting notes, etc.) to achieve several key benefits:
  8 | 
  9 | 1.  **Enhanced Machine Readability:** TOML frontmatter provides structured `key = value` metadata that is easily and reliably parsed by scripts, IDE extensions, reporting tools, and AI assistants. This allows for automation, filtering, validation, and more accurate context understanding by AI without needing to parse the entire Markdown body first. Unlike YAML, TOML's simpler syntax avoids common indentation errors.
 10 | 2.  **Improved Human Readability:** The main body of the document uses standard Markdown (including GFM features like checklists), which is familiar, easy to write, and renders well in most environments.
 11 | 3.  **Co-location & Context:** Storing documents like tasks, ADRs, and context sources directly within the Git repository keeps information close to the code and other artifacts it relates to. The TOML frontmatter (e.g., `related_docs`, `related_tasks`) and inline Markdown links provide rich contextual connections.
 12 | 4.  **Consistency:** Using standardized templates ensures that documents of the same type have a consistent structure and metadata schema, making them easier to find, understand, and process programmatically.
 13 | 5.  **Lifecycle Management:** TOML fields like `status`, `version`, `created_date`, `updated_date`, `last_reviewed`, and `owner` allow for tracking the state and history of documents directly within the file.
 14 | 6.  **Precise AI Guidance:** Metadata fields like `context_type`, `target_audience`, and `granularity` in context source files help guide AI assistants on how and when to use specific information effectively.
 15 | 
 16 | ## Usage Instructions
 17 | 
 18 | 1.  **Identify Need:** Determine the type of document you need to create (e.g., a new feature task, an architecture decision, meeting notes).
 19 | 2.  **Select Template:** Choose the appropriate template file from the list below that matches your document type.
 20 | 3.  **Copy & Rename:** Copy the template file to the relevant directory in the workspace (e.g., copy `01_mdtm_feature.md` to `.tasks/FEATURE_XXX/NNN_➕_description.md`, copy `07_adr.md` to `.decisions/ADR-NNN_description.md`). Follow established naming conventions for the specific document type (e.g., MDTM naming convention).
 21 | 4.  **Fill TOML Frontmatter:** Carefully fill in the required (`<< REQUIRED >>`) and relevant optional fields in the TOML block at the beginning of the file. Pay attention to data types (strings in quotes `""`, arrays in `[]`, dates as `"YYYY-MM-DD"`). Remove any placeholder comments like `<< ... >>`.
 22 | 5.  **Write Markdown Body:** Replace the placeholder content in the Markdown section with your specific information, following the structure provided by the template's headings.
 23 | 6.  **Commit:** Add and commit the new file to Git.
 24 | 
 25 | **Key Principles:**
 26 | *   **Consistency:** Adhere strictly to the TOML field names, data types, and standardized values (e.g., for `status`, `priority`, `type`) defined in the templates and supporting documentation (like the MDTM guide).
 27 | *   **Completeness:** Fill in required TOML fields accurately. Provide sufficient detail in the Markdown body.
 28 | *   **Updates:** Keep the `updated_date` field current when making significant changes. Maintain the accuracy of the `status` field.
 29 | 
 30 | ## Available Templates
 31 | 
 32 | Templates are organized into subdirectories within `.templates/`:

 55 | *   **`15_sop.md`**: For defining *simple* Standard Operating Procedures. Typically stored in `.processes/` or `.docs/standards/`. See `15_sop.README.md` for schema and usage details. (For complex workflows, use the template in `.templates/workflows/`).
 56 | *   **`16_ai_rule.md`**: A minimalist template for defining rules intended for AI context injection (e.g., in `.roo/rules/`). See `16_ai_rule.README.md` for schema and usage details.
 57 | 
 58 | ### Workflow Templates (`.templates/workflows/`)
 59 | 
 60 | *   **`00_workflow_boilerplate.md`**: A comprehensive boilerplate for defining complex, multi-agent workflows or detailed SOPs, including preconditions, postconditions, step-specific error handling, and validation tracking. Use this for documents intended for the `.workflows/` directory or complex processes in `.processes/`.
 61 | 
 62 | ## Creating New Templates
 63 | 
 64 | If none of the existing templates fit your needs, you can create a new one:
 65 | 
 66 | 1.  **Start with Boilerplate:** Copy `00_boilerplate.md` to a new file in this directory, using a descriptive name (e.g., `15_new_template_type.md`).
 67 | 2.  **Define Purpose:** Clearly understand the specific type of document this new template will represent.
 68 | 3.  **Customize TOML:**
 69 |     *   Review the common fields in the boilerplate. Keep those that are relevant.
 70 |     *   Add new TOML fields specific to your document type. Consider what metadata would be useful for searching, filtering, automation, or AI understanding.
 71 |     *   Clearly mark required fields vs. optional fields using comments (e.g., `# << REQUIRED_FIELD_DESCRIPTION >>`).
 72 |     *   Define allowed values for enum-like fields (e.g., `# Options: value1, value2, value3`).
 73 | 4.  **Structure Markdown:**
 74 |     *   Define standard Markdown headings (`## Section Title`) for the key information required in this document type.
 75 |     *   Add placeholder text or instructions under each heading to guide the user.
 76 |     *   Include examples (e.g., code blocks, checklists) where appropriate.
 77 | 5.  **Document:** Update this README file to include your new template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description.
 78 | 6.  **Schema (Optional but Recommended):** Consider formally documenting the schema for your new template's TOML frontmatter (e.g., in `.docs/schemas/`).
 79 | 
 80 | **Example Boilerplate Structure (from `00_boilerplate.md`):**
 81 | 
 82 | ```markdown
 83 | # TOML Frontmatter Starts Here (No Delimiters)

 99 | 
100 | # --- Document Type Specific Fields ---
101 | # Add fields specific to the type of document this template represents
102 | # e.g., for a guide:
103 | # difficulty = "beginner" # beginner, intermediate, advanced
104 | # estimated_time = "~15 minutes"
105 | # prerequisites = ["Basic knowledge of X"]
106 | # learning_objectives = ["Understand Y", "Be able to Z"]
107 |

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->
</tool_name>

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/02-workspace-default-folders.md:
# Workspace Default Hidden Folders

This document lists the standard hidden folders used in this workspace for organizing non-source-code assets. For detailed descriptions, managed-by information, and subfolder conventions, refer to `.docs/standards/project_structure_inventory.md`.

*   **`.archive/`**: Completed/obsolete items (use subfolders like `.archive/tasks/`).
*   **`.snippets/`**: Reusable code snippets.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/03-standard-processes.md:
# Standard Workspace Processes

This document lists standard operating procedures (SOPs) defined for this workspace, located in the `.processes/` directory. Modes should refer to these procedures when performing related tasks.

*   **`.processes/acqa-process.md`**: Procedure for Automated Code Quality Assurance (ACQA). Use this for tasks involving setting up or running linters, formatters, or static analysis.
*   **`.processes/afr-process.md`**: Procedure for Automated File Refactoring (AFR). Use this for tasks involving large-scale or systematic code refactoring.
*   **`.processes/pal-process.md`**: Procedure for Project Asset Listing (PAL). Use this for tasks requiring a structured inventory or listing of project assets.

Refer to the specific file for detailed steps and guidelines for each process.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/04-standard-workflows.md:
# Standard Workspace Workflows

This document lists standard high-level workflows defined for this workspace, located in the `.workflows/` directory. Modes may refer to these workflows for guidance on complex, multi-step tasks.

**Assistant:**

Okay, I have reviewed the template list in `.templates/toml-md/README.md`.

Line 47 indicates that the correct template for an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is `.templates/toml-md/07_adr.md`.

Now, I will read the content of this template file to understand its structure and the required information before we start drafting the ADR for the mode reorganization.

        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->
</tool_name>

**Assistant:**

Okay, I have the ADR template content. Before creating the new ADR file, I need to determine the correct sequential number for the filename (e.g., `ADR-XXX`).

I will list the files in the `.decisions/` directory to see what the last ADR number was.

<list_files>
<path>.decisions/</path>

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

**Assistant:**

Okay, since the `.decisions/` directory is currently empty, this will be the first ADR. I will create `ADR-001` using the `07_adr.md` template and populate it with the details from our discussion.

The file will be named `.decisions/ADR-001_mode_source_reorganisation.md`.

# ADR-001: Mode Source Reorganisation and Dynamic KB Loading

**Status:** proposed

**Date:** 2025-04-18

## Context 🤔

*   **Problem:** The current structure and custom instruction context for modes (e.g., within `vX.Y/modes/.../custom-instructions/`) are becoming large, monolithic, and potentially inefficient. Updating modes requires significant context changes. The nested directory structure can be complex. Naming conventions are verbose and sometimes inconsistent (e.g., use of "Specialist", "Developer"). Emoji usage is not unique.
*   **Goal:** Improve mode maintainability, reduce context size, enhance context relevance through dynamic loading, simplify the directory structure, and establish clearer naming conventions.
*   **Constraints:** Changes must be compatible with the overall Roo Commander system and minimize disruption during transition. The solution should be scalable and potentially adaptable to future database storage.
*   **Source Documents:**
    *   `.docs/notes/changing-the-organising-of-mode-sources.md`
    *   `.docs/notes/changing-the-organising-of-mode-sources-qna.md`

## Decision ✅ / ❌

1.  **Adopt a flat directory structure:** All mode source files will reside under a single root `.mode/` directory (e.g., `.mode/<mode-slug>/`).
2.  **Implement a manifest file:** Create `.mode/manifest.toml` to store mode metadata, including version, description, relationships (delegation targets), grouping/categorization tags, and potentially links to external resources.
3.  **Rename `custom-instructions` to `kb`:** Use `.mode/<mode-slug>/kb/` for knowledge base articles. Retain `context/` and `examples/` subdirectories for potential future use.
4.  **Implement dynamic KB loading:** Modes will dynamically load relevant articles from their `kb/` directory based on the assigned task. The mechanism will involve prompt-based self-assessment by the mode, allowing flexibility rather than rigid rules. Modes should still function without KB input.
5.  **Adopt a new naming convention:** Use a `role-topic` or `area-specialty` format (e.g., `core-code`, `manager-projects`, `lead-backend`, `dev-angular`, `design-ui`). Define a standard set of prefixes.
6.  **Standardize unique emojis:** Assign a unique emoji to each mode where feasible, starting with core roles.
7.  **(Optional) Create default mode folders:** Allow for `.mode/code/`, `.mode/ask/`, etc., to potentially hold KB/context for core modes.
8.  **(Decision) Remove 'Footgun' modes:** These modes will be removed to simplify the mode list.

## Rationale / Justification 💡

*   **Simplicity & Maintainability:** A flat structure and manifest simplify navigation and management compared to deep nesting. Renaming to `kb` is more intuitive.
*   **Efficiency & Cost:** Dynamic KB loading reduces the initial context size sent to the AI, potentially improving performance and lowering costs. It allows for more targeted and up-to-date information (e.g., new API details not in training data).
*   **Clarity:** The new naming convention is more concise and clearly indicates the mode's role and domain. Standard prefixes aid discoverability.
*   **Scalability:** The manifest file provides a structured way to manage metadata and relationships, paving the way for potential future database integration.
*   **Flexibility:** The prompt-based KB loading allows modes autonomy in selecting relevant context.

## Consequences / Implications ➡️

*   **Refactoring Effort:** Significant effort required to rename mode directories, update mode definition files (JSON/YAML), update references in workflows, documentation, and potentially user configurations.
*   **Tooling Updates:** Any scripts or tools relying on the old structure/naming will need modification.
*   **KB Loading Mechanism:** Requires careful design and implementation of the prompt strategy and potentially supporting system logic to ensure modes reliably load relevant context.
*   **Manifest Management:** The `.mode/manifest.toml` file becomes a critical piece of infrastructure requiring careful maintenance.
*   **Transition Plan:** A phased rollout (pilot project) is recommended to mitigate risks. Clear mapping from old to new names is needed.
*   **New Work:**
    *   Define standard naming prefixes.
    *   Design and implement the `manifest.toml` structure and content.
    *   Develop and test the prompt-based KB loading mechanism.
    *   Perform the refactoring of mode directories and definitions.
    *   Update documentation and workflows.
    *   Assign unique emojis.

## Alternatives Considered (Optional Detail) 📝

*   **Retain Versioned Structure:** Keep `vX.Y/modes/` but implement KB loading and new naming within it. (Rejected: Doesn't fully address structural complexity).
*   **Rule-Based KB Loading:** Use strict rules or indexing instead of prompt-based assessment. (Rejected: Less flexible, harder to adapt to diverse tasks).
*   **Hierarchical Structure under `.mode/`:** Group modes by type (e.g., `.mode/backend/django-dev/`). (Considered: Adds some structure back, but manifest tags might suffice).

        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->

**Assistant:**

I have created the Architecture Decision Record (ADR) outlining the proposed changes for mode source reorganization, dynamic Knowledge Base (KB) loading, and naming conventions.

The ADR is located at `.decisions/ADR-001_mode_source_reorganisation.md` and captures the decisions, rationale, and implications based on our discussion and your notes.

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I have created the Architecture Decision Record (ADR) in `.decisions/ADR-001_mode_source_reorganisation.md` to document the plan for reorganizing mode sources, implementing dynamic KB loading, and refining naming conventions, based on your notes and Q&A. This provides a formal basis for proceeding with this architectural change.

i want to point out that we can leave the contents of /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/v7.1
intact, we dont need to change it, we can output our renamed, and refolder modes into /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/v7.2
get them all tidy and organised

the make a new script for
/home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.dev_tools/v7.1/build_dev_v7.1.js
which creates the folders in .roo/rules/mode-name
and then makes the .mode/mode-name folders, and the mode.md file would go in the folder for the mode name, just like it does in the v7.1 structure, with the contents of custom-instructions moved into the relevant kb folder?

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

**Assistant:**

Okay, I understand the plan:

1.  **Target Directory:** We will create the new, reorganized mode structure within the `v7.2/` directory, leaving the existing `v7.1/` structure untouched. This provides a safe way to build and test the new organization.
2.  **New Build Script:** We need to create a new build script, analogous to the one potentially used for `v7.1` (located at `.dev_tools/v7.1/build_dev_v7.1.js`), but adapted for the `v7.2` structure and the decisions outlined in `ADR-001`.
3.  **Script Logic:** This new script should:
    *   Read modes from the `v7.1/` structure.
    *   Apply the new naming convention (e.g., `dev-fastapi` instead of `fastapi-developer`).
    *   Create the corresponding flat directory structure under `v7.2/` (e.g., `v7.2/dev-fastapi/`).
    *   Copy the `mode.md` file into the new directory (`v7.2/dev-fastapi/fastapi-developer.mode.md` - *or should the filename also be renamed? Let's assume yes for now: `v7.2/dev-fastapi/dev-fastapi.mode.md`*).
    *   Create a `kb/` subdirectory (`v7.2/dev-fastapi/kb/`).
    *   Copy the contents of the old `custom-instructions/` directory into the new `kb/` directory.
    *   Generate the `v7.2/manifest.toml` file containing metadata for all processed modes.
    *   **Clarification Needed:** You mentioned creating folders in `.roo/rules/<mode-name>`. Is this *in addition* to the `v7.2/` structure? If so, what content should go into these `.roo/rules/` folders? Or was the intention that all mode-specific files (including rules/kb) live under `v7.2/<mode-slug>/`? ADR-001 proposed `.mode/<mode-slug>/` which we are now mapping to `v7.2/<mode-slug>/`. Let's proceed assuming everything goes into `v7.2/` unless you clarify otherwise.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Finalize Naming Prefixes:** As agreed, let's finalize the prefixes. Based on ADR-001 and your notes, how about this initial set?
    *   `core-`: For fundamental modes (code, ask, debug, architect, commander)
    *   `manager-`: For project/product management modes
    *   `lead-`: For technical lead roles (backend, frontend, design, devops, etc.)
    *   `dev-`: For specific technology/framework developers (angular, react, python, fastapi, etc.)
    *   `design-`: For UI/UX design specialists (ui, mui, shadcn)
    *   `data-`: For database/data handling specialists (sql, mongo, dbt)
    *   `test-`: For testing specialists (e2e, integration)
    *   `infra-`: For infrastructure/DevOps specialists (docker, aws, gcp)
    *   `util-`: For utility or supporting modes (git, writer, reviewer)
    *   `agent-`: For autonomous agents (discovery, research)
    *   `spec-`: (Short for specialist) As a fallback or for highly specific roles not covered above? (e.g., `spec-eslint`, `spec-directus`) - *Or should we stick to `dev-`, `design-`, etc.?*

    Please review and confirm or suggest changes to these prefixes.

2.  **Locate Existing Script:** I need to confirm the location of the v7.1 script. The path `/home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.dev_tools/v7.1/build_dev_v7.1.js` wasn't visible in the initial file listing. I'll check for the `.dev_tools` directory.

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->

**Assistant:**

Okay, the `.dev_tools/` directory exists and contains `v7.1/`. I'll need to list the contents of that subdirectory to find the exact script filename.

Before I do that, let's clarify the remaining points:

1.  **Naming Prefixes:** Please review the proposed prefixes:
    *   `core-` (code, ask, debug, architect, commander)
    *   `manager-` (projects, products)
    *   `lead-` (backend, frontend, design, devops, qa, security, db)
    *   `dev-` (angular, react, python, fastapi, django, php, vue, sveltekit, nextjs, etc.)
    *   `design-` (ui, mui, shadcn, bootstrap, tailwind, d3, threejs)
    *   `data-` (sql, mongo, dbt, elasticsearch, mysql, neon)
    *   `test-` (e2e, integration)
    *   `infra-` (docker, aws, gcp, azure, cloudflare)
    *   `util-` (git, writer, reviewer, eslint, vite)
    *   `agent-` (discovery, research)
    *   `spec-` (directus, frappe, wordpress, clerk, supabase-auth, firebase-auth, openai, huggingface) - *Using `spec-` for platform/API-specific roles.*

    Do these prefixes cover the existing modes well? Any adjustments needed?

2.  **`.roo/rules/` Folders:** You mentioned creating folders in `.roo/rules/<mode-name>`. What is the purpose of these folders? Are they meant to hold mode-specific rules *separate* from the main mode definition and KB in `v7.2/<mode-slug>/`? Or was the idea that all mode content (definition, KB, examples) lives under `v7.2/<mode-slug>/` as per ADR-001?

3.  **Script Filename:** Can you confirm the exact filename of the build script within `.dev_tools/v7.1/`?

<ask_followup_question>
<question>Please clarify the following points before we proceed with creating the new build script:
1. Review and confirm/adjust the proposed naming prefixes (listed above).
2. What is the purpose of the `.roo/rules/<mode-name>` folders you mentioned? Should mode content live there, or entirely within `v7.2/<mode-slug>/`?
3. What is the exact filename of the existing build script in `.dev_tools/v7.1/`?</question>
<follow_up>
<suggest>The prefixes look good. All mode content should live in `v7.2/<mode-slug>/`. The script is `.dev_tools/v7.1/build_modes.js`.</suggest>
<suggest>Let's adjust the prefixes [Specify Changes]. The `.roo/rules/` folders are for [Explain Purpose]. The script is `.dev_tools/v7.1/generate_definitions.js`.</suggest>
<suggest>The prefixes are fine. Forget the `.roo/rules/` folders idea, keep everything in `v7.2/`. The script is `.dev_tools/v7.1/build_dev_v7.1.js`.</suggest>
<suggest>I need to check the script name and think more about the prefixes and `.roo/rules/` folders.</suggest>
</follow_up>

its where we will be putting each modes mode specific instruction, which we will need to create because that is how we will be explaining to the mode about making a decision to lookup its kb and we might add other files in the future

**Assistant:**

Okay, thank you for the clarifications. I understand the plan now:

1.  **Source:** Read mode definitions from `v7.1/modes/`.
2.  **Destination (Working):** Create the new structure in `v7.2/`.
    *   Apply new naming convention (`prefix-topic`) to create `v7.2/<new-mode-slug>/`.
    *   Place the renamed mode definition file inside (e.g., `v7.2/dev-fastapi/dev-fastapi.mode.md`).
    *   Create `v7.2/<new-mode-slug>/kb/` and move content from the old `custom-instructions/` folder into it.
3.  **Destination (Rules):** Create `.roo/rules/<new-mode-slug>/` to hold mode-specific *instructions*, like the rule for KB lookup.
4.  **Manifest:** Generate `v7.2/manifest.toml`.
5.  **Build Script:** The existing script is `.dev_tools/v7.1/build_dev_v7.1.js`. We will create a new script based on this for `v7.2`.
6.  **Naming Prefixes:** I will proceed with the prefixes proposed in the previous turn unless you object.

To ensure I fully grasp the concept of custom instructions and modes, especially regarding the new `.roo/rules/` structure, I will read the two documents you referenced.

First, reading `.docs/roo-code/custom-instructions.md`.

 43 | 
 44 | ## What Are Custom Instructions?
 45 | 
 46 | Custom Instructions define specific behaviors, preferences, and constraints beyond Roo's basic role definition. Examples include coding style, documentation standards, testing requirements, and workflow guidelines.
 47 | 
 48 | ## Setting Custom Instructions
 49 | 
 50 | ### Global Custom Instructions
 51 | 
 52 | These instructions apply across all workspaces and maintain your preferences regardless of which project you're working on.
 53 | 
 54 | **How to set them:**
 55 | 
 56 | <img src="/img/custom-instructions/custom-instructions.png" alt="Roo Code Prompts tab showing global custom instructions interface" width="600" />
 57 | 1.  **Open Prompts Tab:** Click the <Codicon name="notebook" /> icon in the Roo Code top menu bar
 58 | 2.  **Find Section:** Find the "Custom Instructions for All Modes" section
 59 | 3.  **Enter Instructions:** Enter your instructions in the text area
 60 | 4.  **Save Changes:** Click "Done" to save your changes
 61 | 
 62 | ### Workspace-Level Instructions
 63 | 
 64 | These instructions only apply within your current workspace, allowing you to customize Roo Code's behavior for specific projects.
 65 | 
 66 | #### Workspace-Wide Instructions via Files/Directories
 67 | 
 68 | Workspace-wide instructions apply to all modes within the current project and can be defined using files:
 69 | 
 70 | *   **Preferred Method: Directory-Based (`.roo/rules/`)**
 71 |     *   Create a directory named `.roo/rules/` in your workspace root.
 72 |     *   Place instruction files (e.g., `.md`, `.txt`) inside. Roo Code reads files recursively, appending their content to the system prompt in **alphabetical order** based on filename.
 73 |     *   This method takes precedence if the directory exists and contains files.
 74 | *   **Fallback Method: File-Based (`.roorules`)**
 75 |     *   If `.roo/rules/` doesn't exist or is empty, Roo Code looks for a single `.roorules` file in the workspace root.
 76 |     *   If found, its content is loaded.
 77 | 
 78 | #### Mode-Specific Instructions
 79 | 
 80 | Mode-specific instructions can be set in two independent ways that can be used simultaneously:
 81 | 
 82 | 1.  **Using the Prompts Tab:**
 83 | 
 84 |     <img src="/img/custom-instructions/custom-instructions-2.png" alt="Roo Code Prompts tab showing mode-specific custom instructions interface" width="600" />
 85 |     * **Open Tab:** Click the <Codicon name="notebook" /> icon in the Roo Code top menu bar
 86 |     * **Select Mode:** Under the Modes heading, click the button for the mode you want to customize
 87 |     * **Enter Instructions:** Enter your instructions in the text area under "Mode-specific Custom Instructions (optional)"
 88 |     * **Save Changes:** Click "Done" to save your changes
 89 | 
 90 |         :::info Global Mode Rules
 91 |         If the mode itself is global (not workspace-specific), any custom instructions you set for it will also apply globally for that mode across all workspaces.
 92 |         :::
 93 | 
 94 | 2.  **Using Rule Files/Directories:** Provide mode-specific instructions via files:
 95 |     *   **Preferred Method: Directory-Based (`.roo/rules-{modeSlug}/`)**
 96 |         *   Create a directory named `.roo/rules-{modeSlug}/` (e.g., `.roo/rules-docs-writer/`) in your workspace root.
 97 |         *   Place instruction files inside (recursive loading). Files are read and appended to the system prompt in **alphabetical order** by filename.
 98 |         *   This method takes precedence over the fallback file method for the specific mode if the directory exists and contains files.
 99 |     *   **Fallback Method: File-Based (`.roorules-{modeSlug}`)**
100 |         *   If `.roo/rules-{modeSlug}/` doesn't exist or is empty, Roo Code looks for a single `.roorules-{modeSlug}` file (e.g., `.roorules-code`) in the workspace root.
101 |         *   If found, its content is loaded for that mode.
102 | 
103 | Instructions from the Prompts tab, the mode-specific directory/file, and the workspace-wide directory/file are all combined. See the section below for the exact order.
104 | 
105 | ## How Instructions are Combined
106 | 
107 | Instructions are placed in the system prompt in this exact format:
108 | 
109 | ```
110 | ====
111 | USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS
112 | 
113 | The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.
114 | 
115 | [Language Preference (if set)]
116 | 
117 | [Global Instructions (from Prompts Tab)]
118 | 
119 | [Mode-specific Instructions (from Prompts Tab for the current mode)]
120 | 
121 | Mode-Specific Instructions (from Files/Directories):
122 | [Contents of files in .roo/rules-{modeSlug}/ (if directory exists and is not empty)]
123 | [Contents of .roorules-{modeSlug} file (if .roo/rules-{modeSlug}/ does not exist or is empty, and file exists)]
124 | 
125 | Workspace-Wide Instructions (from Files/Directories):
126 | [Contents of files in .roo/rules/ (if directory exists and is not empty)]
127 | [Contents of .roorules file (if .roo/rules/ does not exist or is empty, and file exists)]
128 | 
129 | ====
130 | ```
131 | 
132 | *Note: The exact order ensures that more specific instructions (mode-level) appear before more general ones (workspace-wide), and directory-based rules take precedence over file-based fallbacks within each level.*
133 | 
134 | ## Rules about .rules files
135 | 
136 | * **File Location:** The preferred method uses directories within `.roo/` (`.roo/rules/` and `.roo/rules-{modeSlug}/`). The fallback method uses single files (`.roorules` and `.roorules-{modeSlug}`) located directly in the workspace root.
137 | * **Empty Files:** Empty or missing rule files are silently skipped
138 | * **Source Headers:** Each rule file's contents are included with a header indicating its source
139 | * **Rule Interaction:** Mode-specific rules complement global rules rather than replacing them
140 | 
141 | ## Examples of Custom Instructions
142 | 
143 | * "Always use spaces for indentation, with a width of 4 spaces"
144 | * "Use camelCase for variable names"
145 | * "Write unit tests for all new functions"
146 | * "Explain your reasoning before providing code"
147 | * "Focus on code readability and maintainability"
148 | * "Prioritize using the most common library in the community"
149 | * "When adding new features to websites, ensure they are responsive and accessible"
150 | 
151 | :::tip Pro Tip: File-Based Team Standards
152 | When working in team environments, using the `.roo/rules/` directory structure (and potentially `.roo/rules-{modeSlug}/` directories for specific modes) under version control is the recommended way to standardize Roo's behavior across your team. This allows for better organization of multiple instruction files and ensures consistent code style, documentation practices, and development workflows. The older `.roorules` file method can still be used but offers less flexibility.
153 | :::
154 | 
155 | ## Combining with Custom Modes
156 | 
157 | For advanced customization, combine with [Custom Modes](/features/custom-modes) to create specialized environments with specific tool access, file restrictions, and tailored instructions.

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Rules:

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/00-user-preferences.md:
+++
# --- Basic Metadata ---
id = "user-preferences"
title = "User Preferences"
context_type = "configuration"

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->
</tool_name>

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/02-workspace-default-folders.md:
# Workspace Default Hidden Folders

This document lists the standard hidden folders used in this workspace for organizing non-source-code assets. For detailed descriptions, managed-by information, and subfolder conventions, refer to `.docs/standards/project_structure_inventory.md`.

*   **`.tasks/`**: Active operational task files (MDTM).
*   **`.decisions/`**: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
*   **`.context/`**: Generated summaries, profiles, indices, transient context.
*   **`.docs/`**: Stable documentation, standards, guides, diagrams.
*   **`.workflows/`**: High-level, multi-role process definitions.
*   **`.processes/`**: Granular procedures, SOPs.
*   **`.templates/`**: Standardized templates for artifacts.
*   **`.planning/`**: High-level plans, roadmaps, strategy docs.
*   **`.logs/`**: Command output, build/test logs.
*   **`.reports/`**: Generated reports (test, performance, security, etc.).
*   **`.ideas/`**: Brainstorming, quick notes, scratchpad.
*   **`.archive/`**: Completed/obsolete items (use subfolders like `.archive/tasks/`).
*   **`.snippets/`**: Reusable code snippets.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/03-standard-processes.md:
# Standard Workspace Processes

This document lists standard operating procedures (SOPs) defined for this workspace, located in the `.processes/` directory. Modes should refer to these procedures when performing related tasks.

*   **`.processes/acqa-process.md`**: Procedure for Automated Code Quality Assurance (ACQA). Use this for tasks involving setting up or running linters, formatters, or static analysis.
*   **`.processes/afr-process.md`**: Procedure for Automated File Refactoring (AFR). Use this for tasks involving large-scale or systematic code refactoring.
*   **`.processes/pal-process.md`**: Procedure for Project Asset Listing (PAL). Use this for tasks requiring a structured inventory or listing of project assets.

Refer to the specific file for detailed steps and guidelines for each process.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/04-standard-workflows.md:
# Standard Workspace Workflows

This document lists standard high-level workflows defined for this workspace, located in the `.workflows/` directory. Modes may refer to these workflows for guidance on complex, multi-step tasks.

*   **`.workflows/carefree_one_pager_workflow.md`**: Workflow for creating a single-page website.
*   **`.workflows/new_mode_creation_workflow.md`**: Workflow for creating new custom modes.

Refer to the specific file for detailed steps and guidelines for each workflow.</custom_instructions>
</environment_details>

**Assistant:**

Okay, I've read the documentation on Custom Instructions. It confirms that `.roo/rules-{modeSlug}/` (which corresponds to your `.roo/rules/<new-mode-slug>/`) is the standard location for mode-specific instruction files that get injected into the system prompt.

This clarifies the plan:
*   The `v7.2/<new-mode-slug>/` directory will hold the mode definition (`.mode.md`) and its associated knowledge base (`kb/`), examples (`examples/`), etc.
*   The `.roo/rules/<new-mode-slug>/` directory will hold instruction files (like `.md` or `.txt`) that define specific behaviors or rules for that mode, such as the instruction to consult its KB.
*   The build script needs to create both sets of directories and place the appropriate files within them.

Now, I will read the second document you referenced, `.docs/roo-code/custom-modes.md`, to ensure I have a complete understanding of custom modes before analyzing the existing build script.

  1 | # Custom Modes
  2 | 
  3 | Roo Code allows you to create **custom modes** to tailor Roo's behavior to specific tasks or workflows. Custom modes can be either **global** (available across all projects) or **project-specific** (defined within a single project). Each mode—including custom ones—remembers the last model you used with it, automatically selecting that model when you switch to the mode. This lets you maintain different preferred models for different types of tasks without manual reconfiguration.
  4 | 
  5 | :::info Mode-Specific Instruction File Locations
  6 | You can provide instructions for custom modes using dedicated files or directories within your workspace. This allows for better organization and version control compared to only using the JSON `customInstructions` property.
  7 | 
  8 | **Preferred Method: Directory (`.roo/rules-{mode-slug}/`)**
  9 | ```
 10 | .
 11 | ├── .roo/
 12 | │   └── rules-docs-writer/  # Example for mode slug "docs-writer"
 13 | │       ├── 01-style-guide.md
 14 | │       └── 02-formatting.txt
 15 | └── ... (other project files)
 16 | ```
 17 | 
 18 | **Fallback Method: Single File (`.roorules-{mode-slug}`)**
 19 | ```
 20 | .
 21 | ├── .roorules-docs-writer  # Example for mode slug "docs-writer"
 22 | └── ... (other project files)
 23 | ```
 24 | The directory method takes precedence if it exists and contains files. See [Mode-Specific Instructions via Files/Directories](#mode-specific-instructions-via-filesdirectories) for details.
 25 | :::
 26 | 
 27 | ## Why Use Custom Modes?
 28 | 
 29 | *   **Specialization:** Create modes optimized for specific tasks, like "Documentation Writer," "Test Engineer," or "Refactoring Expert"
 30 | *   **Safety:** Restrict a mode's access to sensitive files or commands. For example, a "Review Mode" could be limited to read-only operations
 31 | *   **Experimentation:** Safely experiment with different prompts and configurations without affecting other modes
 32 | *   **Team Collaboration:** Share custom modes with your team to standardize workflows
 33 | 
 34 |     <img src="/img/custom-modes/custom-modes.png" alt="Overview of custom modes interface" width="400" />
 35 |     *Roo Code's interface for creating and managing custom modes.*
 36 | 
 37 | ## What's Included in a Custom Mode?
 38 | 
 39 | Custom modes allow you to define:
 40 | 
 41 | *   **A unique name and slug:** For easy identification
 42 | *   **A role definition:** Placed at the beginning of the system prompt, this defines Roo's core expertise and personality for the mode. This placement is crucial as it shapes Roo's fundamental understanding and approach to tasks
 43 | *   **Custom instructions:** Added near the end of the system prompt, these provide specific guidelines that modify or refine Roo's behavior for the mode. You can define these using the `customInstructions` JSON property, and/or by adding instruction files to a dedicated directory (see below). The preferred method for file-based instructions is now using a **`.roo/rules-{mode-slug}/` directory**, which allows for better organization and takes precedence over the older `.roorules-{mode-slug}` file method. This structured placement allows for more nuanced control over Roo's responses.
 44 | *   **Allowed tools:** Which Roo Code tools the mode can use (e.g., read files, write files, execute commands)
 45 | *   **File restrictions:** (Optional) Limit file access to specific file types or patterns (e.g., only allow editing `.md` files)
 46 | 
 47 | ## Custom Mode Configuration (JSON Format)
 48 | 
 49 | Both global and project-specific configurations use the same JSON format. Each configuration file contains a `customModes` array of mode definitions:
 50 | 
 51 | ```json
 52 | {
 53 |   "customModes": [
 54 |     {
 55 |       "slug": "mode-name",
 56 |       "name": "Mode Display Name",
 57 |       "roleDefinition": "Mode's role and capabilities",
 58 |       "groups": ["read", "edit"],
 59 |       "customInstructions": "Additional guidelines"
 60 |     }
 61 |   ]
 62 | }
 63 | ```
 64 | 
 65 | ### Required Properties
 66 | 
 67 | #### `slug`
 68 | * A unique identifier for the mode
 69 | * Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
 70 | * Keep it short and descriptive
 71 | * Example: `"docs-writer"`, `"test-engineer"`
 72 | 
 73 | #### `name`
 74 | * The display name shown in the UI
 75 | * Can include spaces and proper capitalization
 76 | * Example: `"Documentation Writer"`, `"Test Engineer"`
 77 | 
 78 | #### `roleDefinition`
 79 | * Detailed description of the mode's role and capabilities
 80 | * Defines Roo's expertise and personality for this mode
 81 | * Example: `"You are a technical writer specializing in clear documentation"`
 82 | 
 83 | #### `groups`
 84 | * Array of allowed tool groups
 85 | * Available groups: `"read"`, `"edit"`, `"browser"`, `"command"`, `"mcp"`
 86 | * Can include file restrictions for the `"edit"` group
 87 | 
 88 | ##### File Restrictions Format
 89 | ```json
 90 | ["edit", {
 91 |   "fileRegex": "\\.md$",
 92 |   "description": "Markdown files only"
 93 | }]
 94 | ```
 95 | 
 96 | ### Understanding File Restrictions
 97 | 
 98 | The `fileRegex` property uses regular expressions to control which files a mode can edit:
 99 | 
100 | * `\\.md$` - Match files ending in ".md"
101 | * `\\.(test|spec)\\.(js|ts)$` - Match test files (e.g., "component.test.js")
102 | * `\\.(js|ts)$` - Match JavaScript and TypeScript files
103 | 
104 | Common regex patterns:
105 | * `\\.` - Match a literal dot
106 | * `(a|b)` - Match either "a" or "b"
107 | * `$` - Match the end of the filename
108 | 
109 | [Learn more about regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)
110 | 
111 | ### Optional Properties
112 | 
113 | #### `customInstructions`
114 | * Additional behavioral guidelines for the mode
115 | * Example: `"Focus on explaining concepts and providing examples"`
116 | 
117 | ### Mode-Specific Instructions via Files/Directories
118 | 
119 | In addition to the `customInstructions` property in JSON, you can provide mode-specific instructions via files in your workspace. This is particularly useful for:
120 | 
121 | *   Organizing lengthy or complex instructions into multiple, manageable files.
122 | *   Managing instructions easily with version control.
123 | *   Allowing non-technical team members to modify instructions without editing JSON.
124 | 
125 | There are two ways Roo Code loads these instructions, with a clear preference for the newer directory-based method:
126 | 
127 | **1. Preferred Method: Directory-Based Instructions (`.roo/rules-{mode-slug}/`)**
128 | 
129 | *   **Structure:** Create a directory named `.roo/rules-{mode-slug}/` in your workspace root. Replace `{mode-slug}` with your mode's slug (e.g., `.roo/rules-docs-writer/`).
130 | *   **Content:** Place one or more files (e.g., `.md`, `.txt`) containing your instructions inside this directory. You can organize instructions further using subdirectories; Roo Code reads files recursively, appending their content to the system prompt in **alphabetical order** based on filename.
131 | *   **Loading:** All instruction files found within this directory structure will be loaded and applied to the specified mode.
132 | 
133 | **2. Fallback (Backward Compatibility): File-Based Instructions (`.roorules-{mode-slug}`)**
134 | 
135 | *   **Structure:** If the `.roo/rules-{mode-slug}/` directory **does not exist or is empty**, Roo Code will look for a single file named `.roorules-{mode-slug}` in your workspace root (e.g., `.roorules-docs-writer`).
136 | *   **Loading:** If found, the content of this single file will be loaded as instructions for the mode.
137 | 
138 | **Precedence:**
139 | 
140 | *   The **directory-based method (`.roo/rules-{mode-slug}/`) takes precedence**. If this directory exists and contains files, any corresponding root-level `.roorules-{mode-slug}` file will be **ignored** for that mode.
141 | *   This ensures that projects migrated to the new directory structure behave predictably, while older projects using the single-file method remain compatible.
142 | 
143 | **Combining with JSON `customInstructions`:**
144 | 
145 | *   Instructions loaded from either the directory or the fallback file are combined with the `customInstructions` property defined in the mode's JSON configuration.
146 | *   Typically, the content from the files/directories is appended after the content from the JSON `customInstructions` property.
147 | 
148 | ## Configuration Precedence
149 | 
150 | Mode configurations are applied in this order:
151 | 
152 | 1. Project-level mode configurations (from `.roomodes`)
153 | 2. Global mode configurations (from `custom_modes.json`)
154 | 3. Default mode configurations
155 | 
156 | This means that project-specific configurations will override global configurations, which in turn override default configurations.
157 | *   **Note on Instruction Files:** Within the loading of mode-specific instructions from the filesystem, the directory `.roo/rules-{mode-slug}/` takes precedence over the single file `.roorules-{mode-slug}` found in the workspace root.
158 | 
159 | ## Creating Custom Modes
160 | 
161 | You have three options for creating custom modes:
162 | 
163 | ### 1. Ask Roo! (Recommended)
164 | 
165 | You can quickly create a basic custom mode by asking Roo Code to do it for you. For example:
166 | ```
167 | Create a new mode called "Documentation Writer". It should only be able to read files and write Markdown files.
168 | ```
169 | Roo Code will guide you through the process. However, for fine-tuning modes or making specific adjustments, you'll want to use the Prompts tab or manual configuration methods described below.
170 | :::info
171 | #### Custom Mode Creation Settings
172 | When enabled, Roo allows you to create custom modes using prompts like 'Make me a custom mode that...'. Disabling this reduces your system prompt by about 700 tokens when this feature isn't needed. When disabled you can still manually create custom modes using the + button above or by editing the related config JSON. 
173 | <img src="/img/custom-modes/custom-modes-1.png" alt="Enable Custom Mode Creation Through Prompts setting" width="600" />
174 | You can find this setting within the prompt settings by clicking the <Codicon name="notebook" /> icon in the Roo Code top menu bar.
175 | :::
176 | 
177 | ### 2. Using the Prompts Tab
178 | 
179 | 1.  **Open Prompts Tab:** Click the <Codicon name="notebook" /> icon in the Roo Code top menu bar
180 | 2.  **Create New Mode:** Click the <Codicon name="add" /> button to the right of the Modes heading
181 | 3.  **Fill in Fields:**
182 | 
183 |         <img src="/img/custom-modes/custom-modes-2.png" alt="Custom mode creation interface in the Prompts tab" width="600" />
184 |         *The custom mode creation interface showing fields for name, slug, save location, role definition, available tools, and custom instructions.*
185 | 
186 |     * **Name:** Enter a display name for the mode
187 |     * **Slug:** Enter a lowercase identifier (letters, numbers, and hyphens only)
188 |     * **Save Location:** Choose Global (via `custom_modes.json`, available across all workspaces) or Project-specific (via `.roomodes` file in project root)
189 |     * **Role Definition:** Define Roo's expertise and personality for this mode (appears at the start of the system prompt)
190 |     * **Available Tools:** Select which tools this mode can use
191 |     * **Custom Instructions:** (Optional) Add behavioral guidelines specific to this mode (appears at the end of the system prompt)
192 | 4.  **Create Mode:** Click the "Create Mode" button to save your new mode
193 | 
194 | Note: File type restrictions can only be added through manual configuration.
195 | 
196 | ### 3. Manual Configuration
197 | 
198 | You can configure custom modes by editing JSON files through the Prompts tab:
199 | 
200 | Both global and project-specific configurations can be edited through the Prompts tab:
201 | 
202 | 1.  **Open Prompts Tab:** Click the <Codicon name="notebook" /> icon in the Roo Code top menu bar
203 | 2.  **Access Settings Menu:** Click the <Codicon name="bracket" /> button to the right of the Modes heading
204 | 3.  **Choose Configuration:**
205 |     * Select "Edit Global Modes" to edit `custom_modes.json` (available across all workspaces)
206 |     * Select "Edit Project Modes" to edit `.roomodes` file (in project root)
207 | 4.  **Edit Configuration:** Modify the JSON file that opens
208 | 5.  **Save Changes:** Roo Code will automatically detect the changes
209 | 
210 | ## Example Configurations
211 | 
212 | Each example shows different aspects of mode configuration:
213 | 
214 | ### Basic Documentation Writer
215 | ```json
216 | {
217 |   "customModes": [{
218 |     "slug": "docs-writer",
219 |     "name": "Documentation Writer",
220 |     "roleDefinition": "You are a technical writer specializing in clear documentation",
221 |     "groups": [
222 |       "read",
223 |       ["edit", { "fileRegex": "\\.md$", "description": "Markdown files only" }]
224 |     ],
225 |     "customInstructions": "Focus on clear explanations and examples"
226 |   }]
227 | }
228 | ```
229 | 
230 | ### Test Engineer with File Restrictions
231 | ```json
232 | {
233 |   "customModes": [{
234 |     "slug": "test-engineer",
235 |     "name": "Test Engineer",
236 |     "roleDefinition": "You are a test engineer focused on code quality",
237 |     "groups": [
238 |       "read",
239 |       ["edit", { "fileRegex": "\\.(test|spec)\\.(js|ts)$", "description": "Test files only" }]
240 |     ]
241 |   }]
242 | }
243 | ```
244 | 
245 | ### Project-Specific Mode Override
246 | ```json
247 | {
248 |   "customModes": [{
249 |     "slug": "code",
250 |     "name": "Code (Project-Specific)",
251 |     "roleDefinition": "You are a software engineer with project-specific constraints",
252 |     "groups": [
253 |       "read",
254 |       ["edit", { "fileRegex": "\\.(js|ts)$", "description": "JS/TS files only" }]
255 |     ],
256 |     "customInstructions": "Focus on project-specific JS/TS development"
257 |   }]
258 | }
259 | ```
260 | By following these instructions, you can create and manage custom modes to enhance your workflow with Roo-Code.
261 | 
262 | ## Understanding Regex in Custom Modes
263 | 
264 | Regex patterns in custom modes let you precisely control which files Roo can edit:
265 | 
266 | ### Basic Syntax
267 | 
268 | When you specify `fileRegex` in a custom mode, you're creating a pattern that file paths must match:
269 | 
270 | ```json
271 | ["edit", { "fileRegex": "\\.md$", "description": "Markdown files only" }]
272 | ```
273 | 
274 | ### Important Rules
275 | 
276 | - **Double Backslashes:** In JSON, backslashes must be escaped with another backslash. So `\.md$` becomes `\\.md$`
277 | - **Path Matching:** Patterns match against the full file path, not just the filename
278 | - **Case Sensitivity:** Regex patterns are case-sensitive by default
279 | 
280 | ### Common Pattern Examples
281 | 
282 | | Pattern | Matches | Doesn't Match |
283 | |---------|---------|---------------|
284 | | `\\.md$` | `readme.md`, `docs/guide.md` | `script.js`, `readme.md.bak` |
285 | | `^src/.*` | `src/app.js`, `src/components/button.tsx` | `lib/utils.js`, `test/src/mock.js` |
286 | | `\\.(css\|scss)$` | `styles.css`, `theme.scss` | `styles.less`, `styles.css.map` |
287 | | `docs/.*\\.md$` | `docs/guide.md`, `docs/api/reference.md` | `guide.md`, `src/docs/notes.md` |
288 | | `^(?!.*(test\|spec)).*\\.js$` | `app.js`, `utils.js` | `app.test.js`, `utils.spec.js` |
289 | 
290 | ### Pattern Building Blocks
291 | 
292 | - `\\.` - Match a literal dot (period)
293 | - `$` - Match the end of the string
294 | - `^` - Match the beginning of the string
295 | - `.*` - Match any character (except newline) zero or more times
296 | - `(a|b)` - Match either "a" or "b"
297 | - `(?!...)` - Negative lookahead (exclude matches)
298 | 
299 | ### Testing Your Patterns
300 | 
301 | Before applying a regex pattern to a custom mode:
302 | 
303 | 1. Test it on sample file paths to ensure it matches what you expect
304 | 2. Remember that in JSON, each backslash needs to be doubled (`\d` becomes `\\d`)
305 | 3. Start with simpler patterns and build complexity gradually
306 | 
307 | 
308 | :::tip
309 | ### Let Roo Build Your Regex Patterns
310 | Instead of writing complex regex patterns manually, you can ask Roo to create them for you! Simply describe which files you want to include or exclude:
311 | ```
312 | Create a regex pattern that matches JavaScript files but excludes test files
313 | ```
314 | Roo will generate the appropriate pattern with proper escaping for JSON configuration.

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->
</tool_name>

**Assistant:**

Okay, I have read the documentation on Custom Modes and Custom Instructions. This confirms the structure and purpose of both the mode definition files (which will go into `v7.2/<new-mode-slug>/`) and the mode-specific instruction files (which will go into `.roo/rules/<new-mode-slug>/`).

Now I need to understand the existing build script to adapt it. I will read the content of `.dev_tools/v7.1/build_dev_v7.1.js`.

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->
</tool_name>

**Assistant:**

Okay, I have analyzed the existing `build_dev_v7.1.js` script.

Here's a summary of its functionality:
*   It finds all `.mode.md` files within the `v7.1/modes/` directory.
*   For each file, it extracts the TOML frontmatter.
*   It validates that the TOML contains `id`, `name`, and `system_prompt`, and that the `id` matches the filename.
*   It creates an entry for a `.roomodes` file (which defines custom modes for Roo Code), using the TOML `id` as `slug`, `name`, and `system_prompt` as `roleDefinition`. It assigns permissive tool `groups` for development.
*   It creates an empty `.roo/rules-{id}/` directory for each mode.
*   **Crucially, the code to copy subdirectories like `custom-instructions` is commented out.**
*   Finally, it writes the collected mode definitions into the `.roomodes` file in the workspace root.

Now, let's adapt this logic for the `v7.2` structure as discussed and outlined in `ADR-001`.

**Plan for `build_dev_v7.2.js`:**

1.  **Setup:** Define source (`v7.1/modes`), v7.2 target (`v7.2/`), rules target (`.roo/rules/`), and manifest path (`v7.2/manifest.toml`).
2.  **Find Modes:** Recursively find all `.mode.md` files in the source directory.
3.  **Process Each Mode:**
    *   Read the `.mode.md` file and extract TOML.
    *   Validate required TOML fields (`id`, `name`, `system_prompt`).
    *   **Determine New Slug & Prefix:** Analyze the source file path relative to `v7.1/modes/` (e.g., `worker/backend/fastapi-developer`) and the original `id` (`fastapi-developer`) to determine the correct prefix (e.g., `dev-`) and the new slug (e.g., `dev-fastapi`).
    *   **Create `v7.2` Directory:** Create `v7.2/<new-slug>/`.
    *   **Copy & Rename `.mode.md`:** Copy the original `.mode.md` to `v7.2/<new-slug>/<new-slug>.mode.md`. **Modify the `id` field within the TOML frontmatter of the *copied* file to match the `<new-slug>`.**
    *   **Create & Populate `kb/`:** Create `v7.2/<new-slug>/kb/`. Copy the contents of the original `v7.1/.../<old-id>/custom-instructions/` directory (if it exists) into this new `kb/` directory.
    *   **Create Rules Directory:** Create `.roo/rules/<new-slug>/`.
    *   **Create KB Lookup Rule:** Create a standard instruction file (e.g., `01-kb-lookup-rule.md`) inside `.roo/rules/<new-slug>/` instructing the mode to consult its KB.
    *   **Prepare Manifest Entry:** Collect metadata for the manifest (new slug, name, role definition, source path, v7.2 path, rules path, prefix/tags).
4.  **Write Manifest:** Write the collected metadata to `v7.2/manifest.toml`.

I will now create the new script file `.dev_tools/v7.2/build_dev_v7.2.js` with this adapted logic. I'll need helper functions for determining the new slug and copying directories.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
const TOML = require('@iarna/toml');

// --- Configuration ---
const modesSourceDir = path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', 'v7.1', 'modes');
const v72TargetRootDir = path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', 'v7.2');
const rulesTargetRootDir = path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', '.roo', 'rules');
const manifestFilePath = path.join(v72TargetRootDir, 'manifest.toml');
const defaultKbLookupRuleContent = `
# Rule: Consult Knowledge Base

Before proceeding with the task, review the contents of your Knowledge Base (KB) located in your mode's source directory (\`v7.2/<your-mode-slug>/kb/\`).
Assess if any documents within the KB are relevant to the current task.
If relevant documents are found, incorporate their information into your response or actions.
If no relevant documents are found, proceed with the task using your general knowledge.
`.trim();

// --- Helper Functions ---

// Recursively find all .mode.md files
function findModeFiles(dir, fileList = []) {
    try {
        const files = fs.readdirSync(dir);
        files.forEach(file => {
            const filePath = path.join(dir, file);
            try {

                    findModeFiles(filePath, fileList);
                } else if (file.endsWith('.mode.md')) {

        });
    } catch (readErr) {

# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->
</tool_name>

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/02-workspace-default-folders.md:
# Workspace Default Hidden Folders

This document lists the standard hidden folders used in this workspace for organizing non-source-code assets. For detailed descriptions, managed-by information, and subfolder conventions, refer to `.docs/standards/project_structure_inventory.md`.

*   **`.tasks/`**: Active operational task files (MDTM).
*   **`.decisions/`**: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
*   **`.context/`**: Generated summaries, profiles, indices, transient context.
*   **`.docs/`**: Stable documentation, standards, guides, diagrams.
*   **`.workflows/`**: High-level, multi-role process definitions.
*   **`.processes/`**: Granular procedures, SOPs.
*   **`.templates/`**: Standardized templates for artifacts.
*   **`.planning/`**: High-level plans, roadmaps, strategy docs.
*   **`.logs/`**: Command output, build/test logs.
*   **`.reports/`**: Generated reports (test, performance, security, etc.).
*   **`.ideas/`**: Brainstorming, quick notes, scratchpad.
*   **`.archive/`**: Completed/obsolete items (use subfolders like `.archive/tasks/`).
*   **`.snippets/`**: Reusable code snippets.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/03-standard-processes.md:
# Standard Workspace Processes

This document lists standard operating procedures (SOPs) defined for this workspace, located in the `.processes/` directory. Modes should refer to these procedures when performing related tasks.

*   **`.processes/acqa-process.md`**: Procedure for Automated Code Quality Assurance (ACQA). Use this for tasks involving setting up or running linters, formatters, or static analysis.
*   **`.processes/afr-process.md`**: Procedure for Automated File Refactoring (AFR). Use this for tasks involving large-scale or systematic code refactoring.
*   **`.processes/pal-process.md`**: Procedure for Project Asset Listing (PAL). Use this for tasks requiring a structured inventory or listing of project assets.

Refer to the specific file for detailed steps and guidelines for each process.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/04-standard-workflows.md:
# Standard Workspace Workflows

This document lists standard high-level workflows defined for this workspace, located in the `.workflows/` directory. Modes may refer to these workflows for guidance on complex, multi-step tasks.

*   **`.workflows/carefree_one_pager_workflow.md`**: Workflow for creating a single-page website.
*   **`.workflows/new_mode_creation_workflow.md`**: Workflow for creating new custom modes.

Refer to the specific file for detailed steps and guidelines for each workflow.</custom_instructions>

**Assistant:**

Okay, the new build script `.dev_tools/v7.2/build_dev_v7.2.js` has been created successfully.

This script is designed to perform the reorganization based on our plan:
*   Read modes from `v7.1/modes/`.
*   Apply the new naming convention and create the corresponding structure in `v7.2/`.
*   Copy and rename mode definition files, updating their internal `id`.
*   Move `custom-instructions` content to the new `kb/` directories.
*   Create mode-specific rule directories in `.roo/rules/` with a default KB lookup instruction.
*   Generate the `v7.2/manifest.toml` file.

The next step is to execute this script. This requires Node.js and the `@iarna/toml` package. I will attempt to run the script. If it fails due to missing dependencies, we may need to install `@iarna/toml` using npm or yarn.

Executing the build script:
<execute_command>
<command>node .dev_tools/v7.2/build_dev_v7.2.js</command>
</execute_command>

<feedback>
i think i would rather we are very carefully dealing with each mode separately rather than trying to do this in one script. how about we make a thoroughly considered workflow instead

    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

**Assistant:**

Understood. You prefer a more deliberate, manual approach for migrating each mode, guided by a detailed workflow, rather than using a single script to process everything at once. This allows for careful handling and verification of each mode individually.

Let's create that workflow document. According to the template list in `.templates/toml-md/README.md` (line 60), the template `.templates/workflows/00_workflow_boilerplate.md` is suitable for defining complex workflows.

I will now read this template to understand its structure before drafting the migration workflow.

 55 | *   **Example Structure for Steps:**
 56 | 
 57 |     *   **Step X: [Action Name] (Coordinator Task)**
 58 |         *   **Description:** What the Coordinator does in this step (e.g., analyze inputs, verify paths, prepare context).
 59 |         *   **Inputs:** Data/files needed by the Coordinator.
 60 |         *   **Procedure:** Coordinator's actions (e.g., use `list_files`, `read_file`).

 62 |         *   **Error Handling:** How the Coordinator handles errors in this step.
 63 |         *   **Decision Point:** If [condition], go to Step Y, else go to Step Z.
 64 | 
 65 |     *   **Step Y: [Action Name] (Coordinator delegates to [Delegate Role])**
 66 |         *   **Description:** The overall goal of the delegated task.
 67 |         *   **Tool:** `new_task`
 68 |         *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** List the specific data, file paths, template content, context summaries, or specifications the Coordinator MUST provide to the delegate.

# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Assistant:**

Okay, I understand. A detailed workflow provides a clearer, step-by-step guide for this migration process, allowing for careful execution and verification for each mode.

I have reviewed the workflow template (`.templates/workflows/00_workflow_boilerplate.md`) and will now create the workflow document outlining the manual migration steps for converting a v7.1 mode to the new v7.2 structure.

The workflow will be saved to `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md`.

*   This workflow applies to each individual mode located within the `v7.1/modes/` directory structure.
*   It covers file copying, renaming, content modification (TOML ID), directory creation, and manifest updating.
*   It assumes the naming prefixes and logic are defined (as per ADR-001).

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities 👤
*   **Roo Commander (or designated Migration Agent):** Responsible for executing all steps of this workflow accurately for each mode being migrated.

## 4. Preconditions🚦
*   The v7.1 mode definition file (`v7.1/modes/.../<old-slug>.mode.md`) exists.
*   `ADR-001_mode_source_reorganisation.md` is approved or accepted as the guiding document.
*   The logic for determining new slugs and prefixes is defined and understood (can be derived from the `getNewSlugAndPrefix` function in the previously created script `.dev_tools/v7.2/build_dev_v7.2.js`).
*   The target root directories (`v7.2/` and `.roo/rules/`) exist.
*   The manifest file `v7.2/manifest.toml` exists (or will be created during the first mode migration).

## 5. Reference Documents & Tools 📚🛠️
*   `.decisions/ADR-001_mode_source_reorganisation.md`
*   `.docs/roo-code/custom-modes.md`
*   `.docs/roo-code/custom-instructions.md`
*   Logic within `.dev_tools/v7.2/build_dev_v7.2.js` (specifically `getNewSlugAndPrefix` function) for naming conventions.
*   **Tools:** `list_files`, `read_file`, `write_to_file`, `apply_diff` (optional, for manifest update).

## 6. Workflow Steps 🪜

*   **Step 1: Select Mode & Identify Paths (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Choose the next v7.1 mode to migrate. Identify its source `.mode.md` file path and the path to its `custom-instructions` directory (if it exists).
    *   **Inputs:** Knowledge of which modes in `v7.1/modes/` need migration.
    *   **Procedure:** Use `list_files` on `v7.1/modes/` (recursively if needed) to locate the mode. Note the full path to `<old-slug>.mode.md` and `custom-instructions/`.
    *   **Outputs:** `source_mode_file_path`, `source_ci_dir_path` (can be null).
    *   **Error Handling:** If source file not found, stop workflow for this mode and log error.

*   **Step 2: Read Source Mode Definition (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Read the content of the source `.mode.md` file.
    *   **Inputs:** `source_mode_file_path`.
    *   **Procedure:** Use `read_file` tool.
    *   **Outputs:** `source_mode_content`.
    *   **Error Handling:** If read fails, stop workflow for this mode and log error.

*   **Step 3: Extract TOML & Validate (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Extract the TOML frontmatter from the source content and validate required fields (`id`, `name`, `system_prompt`). Verify `id` matches the old slug derived from the filename.
    *   **Inputs:** `source_mode_content`.
    *   **Procedure:** Parse TOML (internal logic). Check for required fields. Compare `id` with filename slug.
    *   **Outputs:** Parsed `toml_data`, `old_slug`.
    *   **Error Handling:** If TOML is missing, invalid, or validation fails, stop workflow for this mode and log error.

*   **Step 4: Determine New Slug & Paths (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Apply the defined naming logic (based on source path and old slug) to determine the `new_slug` and `prefix`. Define all target paths.
    *   **Inputs:** `source_mode_file_path`, `old_slug`.
    *   **Procedure:** Apply naming logic (referencing `getNewSlugAndPrefix` concept). Construct target paths: `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_mode_file_path`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`, `target_kb_rule_file`.
    *   **Outputs:** `new_slug`, `prefix`, all target paths.
    *   **Error Handling:** If new slug cannot be determined, stop workflow for this mode and log error.

*   **Step 5: Create Target Directories (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Create the necessary target directories for the mode in `v7.2/` and `.roo/rules/`.
    *   **Inputs:** `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`.
    *   **Procedure:** Use `write_to_file` to create a dummy file (e.g., `.placeholder`) in each directory to ensure creation. Alternatively, use `execute_command` with `mkdir -p`. *Using `write_to_file` is generally safer.*
        *   `write_to_file` path=`${target_v72_mode_dir}/.placeholder` content="" line_count=0
        *   `write_to_file` path=`${target_kb_dir}/.placeholder` content="" line_count=0
        *   `write_to_file` path=`${target_rules_dir}/.placeholder` content="" line_count=0
    *   **Outputs:** Confirmation of directory creation (implicit via tool success).
    *   **Error Handling:** If directory creation fails, stop workflow and log error.

*   **Step 6: Copy & Modify Mode Definition (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Copy the source mode content to the new location, renaming the file and updating the `id` field within the TOML frontmatter.
    *   **Inputs:** `source_mode_content`, `old_slug`, `new_slug`, `target_mode_file_path`.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Modify `source_mode_content` in memory: Replace `id = "<old_slug>"` with `id = "<new_slug>"`. Be precise with the replacement.
        2.  Use `write_to_file` with the modified content and `target_mode_file_path`.
    *   **Outputs:** New mode definition file created at `target_mode_file_path`.
    *   **Error Handling:** If write fails, stop workflow and log error. Verify the `id` was actually changed by reading the new file back.

*   **Step 7: Migrate KB Content (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Copy all files and subdirectories from the source `custom-instructions` directory (if it exists) to the target `kb` directory.
    *   **Inputs:** `source_ci_dir_path`, `target_kb_dir`.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Check if `source_ci_dir_path` exists and is not null.
        2.  If it exists, use `list_files` (recursive: true) on `source_ci_dir_path`.
        3.  For each file found:
            *   Use `read_file` to get its content.
            *   Construct the corresponding path within `target_kb_dir`.
            *   Use `write_to_file` to write the content to the target path.
        4.  If `source_ci_dir_path` does not exist, skip this step.
    *   **Outputs:** KB content replicated in `target_kb_dir`.
    *   **Error Handling:** Log errors if reading or writing individual KB files fails, but attempt to continue with other files.

*   **Step 8: Create KB Lookup Rule (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Create the standard KB lookup rule file within the mode's specific rules directory.
    *   **Inputs:** `target_kb_rule_file`, `new_slug`.
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Prepare the rule content, injecting the `new_slug` into the placeholder path.
        2.  Use `write_to_file` to create `target_kb_rule_file` with the prepared content.
    *   **Outputs:** KB lookup rule file created.
    *   **Error Handling:** If write fails, stop workflow and log error.

*   **Step 9: Update Manifest File (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Add or update the entry for the migrated mode in `v7.2/manifest.toml`.
    *   **Inputs:** `new_slug`, `prefix`, `toml_data.name`, `toml_data.system_prompt`, `source_mode_file_path`, `target_mode_file_path`, `target_rules_dir`, `toml_data.tags` (optional).
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Use `read_file` to get the current content of `v7.2/manifest.toml`. If it doesn't exist or read fails, start with an empty TOML structure (`{ modes: {} }`).
        2.  Parse the TOML content (internal logic or using `@iarna/toml` if available via a tool/script).
        3.  Create/update the entry `manifest_data.modes[new_slug]` with the required fields (slug, name, prefix, role_definition, source_path_v7_1, path_v7_2, rules_path, tags). Ensure paths are relative to the workspace root and use forward slashes.
        4.  Stringify the updated manifest data back into TOML format.
        5.  Use `write_to_file` to save the updated content back to `v7.2/manifest.toml`.
    *   **Outputs:** Updated `v7.2/manifest.toml`.
    *   **Error Handling:** If reading, parsing, stringifying, or writing the manifest fails, stop workflow and log error. Consider backup/restore mechanisms for the manifest.

*   **Step 10: Verification (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Perform basic checks to verify the migration steps were successful.
    *   **Inputs:** All target paths, `new_slug`.
    *   **Procedure:**
        *   Use `list_files` on `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir` to confirm existence and expected files (`<new-slug>.mode.md`, KB files, `01-kb-lookup-rule.md`).
        *   Use `read_file` on `target_mode_file_path` and verify the `id` in the TOML matches `new_slug`.
        *   Use `read_file` on `v7.2/manifest.toml` and verify the entry for `new_slug` exists and is correct.
    *   **Outputs:** Confirmation of successful migration for this mode or list of verification failures.
    *   **Error Handling:** Log any verification failures. Manual intervention may be required.

## 7. Postconditions ✅
*   The migrated mode exists in the `v7.2/` directory with the new naming convention and structure.
*   The mode's KB content is located in `v7.2/<new-slug>/kb/`.
*   The mode definition file (`.mode.md`) has its internal TOML `id` updated to `new_slug`.
*   The mode-specific rules directory (`.roo/rules/<new-slug>/`) exists and contains the KB lookup rule.
*   The `v7.2/manifest.toml` file accurately reflects the migrated mode's details.

## 8. Error Handling & Escalation (Overall) ⚠️
*   Log all errors encountered during the process for a specific mode.
*   If a critical step (e.g., creating directories, writing core files, updating manifest) fails, stop the workflow for that specific mode and report the failure.
*   Minor errors (e.g., failure to copy one KB file) should be logged, but the workflow may attempt to continue for the rest of the mode's migration, reporting the partial success/failure at the end.
*   Persistent or critical failures should be escalated to the user for manual investigation.

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->
</tool_name>

**Assistant:**

Okay, the workflow document `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md` has been successfully created.

This workflow provides a detailed, step-by-step process for manually migrating each mode from the v7.1 structure to the new v7.2 structure, incorporating the decisions from `ADR-001`. It covers identifying source files, determining the new slug, creating target directories in both `v7.2/` and `.roo/rules/`, modifying the mode definition, migrating KB content, creating the KB lookup rule, and updating the manifest file.

<attempt_completion>
<result>
We have discussed your ideas for reorganizing mode sources, formalized the plan in `ADR-001_mode_source_reorganisation.md`, and created a detailed manual workflow in `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md`.

# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->
</tool_name>

**Assistant:**

You are absolutely right. My apologies. I created the workflow with all steps assigned to the Coordinator, which defeats the purpose of defining roles and potential delegation. Furthermore, I neglected to consult and integrate the standard processes (`acqa-process.md`, `afr-process.md`, `pal-process.md`) as required by our workspace rules.

To rectify this, I will first read the standard process documents to understand their content and applicability to the mode migration task.

Starting with the Automated Code Quality Assurance (ACQA) process.

  1 | # Process: Adaptive Confidence-based Quality Assurance (ACQA) v1.0
  2 | 
  3 | **Date:** 2025-04-15
  4 | 
  5 | **Authors:** Roo Commander, User (Jeremy), Gemini
  6 | 
  7 | ---
  8 | 
  9 | **1. Core Concept & Goals**
 10 | 
 11 | **Concept:** ACQA establishes a standard operational procedure where AI-generated artifacts (code, configuration, documentation) are assessed for potential risk (via an internal "Confidence Score"). This score, combined with a user-defined "Caution Level," dictates the level of automated Quality Assurance (QA) applied before the artifact is finalized or presented. This process applies recursively to delegated tasks within the Roo Code multi-agent system.
 12 | 
 13 | **Goals:**
 14 | *   **Improve Reliability:** Proactively catch errors, logical flaws, or specification deviations.
 15 | *   **Increase User Trust:** Provide transparency and configurable assurance levels.
 16 | *   **Manage Complexity:** Apply appropriate scrutiny based on task difficulty and assessed risk.
 17 | *   **Optimize Workflow:** Balance QA overhead with speed according to user preference.
 18 | *   **Standardize Process:** Create a consistent, teachable workflow for all participating agents.
 19 | 
 20 | **Analogy:** A dynamic, context-aware peer review system where the depth of review adapts based on the perceived risk of the work and the project's overall quality requirements.
 21 | 
 22 | **2. Core Components**
 23 | 
 24 | *   **Agent Roles (within ACQA):**
 25 |     *   **Roo Commander (Coordinator):**
 26 |         *   Receives user requests, performs initial assessment.
 27 |         *   Determines/retrieves active `User Caution Level`.
 28 |         *   Delegates tasks to appropriate Developer Agents, providing necessary context (specs, files, user intent).
 29 |         *   Receives results (artifact + Confidence Score + rationale) from Developer Agents.
 30 |         *   Executes QA Decision Logic (Confidence vs. Caution).
 31 |         *   Delegates QA tasks (Reviewer/Tester) **with full context** (artifact, original prompt, relevant specifications, confidence score, required QA level).
 32 |         *   Receives QA feedback.
 33 |         *   **Critically analyzes** QA feedback for validity and significance against specifications.
 34 |         *   Initiates revisions via Boomerang Tasks or direct re-delegation if necessary, providing specific feedback.
 35 |         *   Integrates final results.
 36 |         *   Reports outcome and QA steps taken to the user.
 37 |     *   **Developer Agent(s) (e.g., `mode-maintainer`, `react-specialist`):**
 38 |         *   Responsible for generating/modifying artifacts per task instructions.
 39 |         *   **Mandatory:** Performs self-assessment to generate a `Confidence Score` (Low/Medium/High) and rationale for their output *before* reporting completion.
 40 |         *   Packages result: artifact + Confidence Score + rationale.
 41 |         *   Acts as a Coordinator for any sub-tasks they delegate, applying the ACQA process recursively.
 42 |     *   **Reviewer Agent(s) (e.g., `code-reviewer`, `second-opinion`, `technical-writer`):**
 43 |         *   Receives artifact, original prompt, specs, confidence score, and required QA level from the Coordinator.
 44 |         *   Analyzes the artifact *against the provided specifications and context*.
 45 |         *   Provides structured feedback on deviations, errors, inconsistencies, quality issues.
 46 |     *   **Tester Agent(s) (Optional/Advanced; e.g., `e2e-tester`, `integration-tester`):**
 47 |         *   Activated in low-confidence/high-caution scenarios.
 48 |         *   Focuses on identifying edge cases, suggesting test inputs/scenarios, potentially generating test stubs or using tools (`execute_command`) to run existing tests.
 49 | 
 50 | *   **Confidence Score:**
 51 |     *   **Nature:** Internal heuristic (Low, Medium, High) indicating estimated correctness/completeness risk. Generated by the Developer Agent.
 52 |     *   **Calculation Factors:** Task complexity/ambiguity/novelty, artifact length/complexity, error handling presence, risky patterns, dependencies touched, (optional) internal generation metrics.
 53 | 
 54 | *   **User Caution Level:**
 55 |     *   **Nature:** User-defined setting (`Minimal`, `Balanced`, `Thorough`) controlling QA overhead vs. speed.
 56 |     *   **Setting:**
 57 |         *   Default: `Balanced`.
 58 |         *   Configuration: Stored in a project configuration file (e.g., `.roo/project_config.toml`), potentially alongside user profile info (name, experience, preferred stack).
 59 |         *   Initial Setup: Commander can infer or ask during project onboarding.
 60 | 
 61 | *   **QA Actions (Triggered by Coordinator based on Confidence/Caution):**
 62 |     *   `None` (High Confidence / Minimal Caution)
 63 |     *   `Basic Linting/Formatting` (Potentially via `execute_command`)
 64 |     *   `Standard AI Peer Review` (Reviewer Agent, Balanced/Thorough Caution for Medium/Low Confidence)
 65 |     *   `Intensive AI Peer Review` (Reviewer Agent, Thorough Caution for Low Confidence)
 66 |     *   `Test Suggestion / Edge Case Analysis` (Tester Agent, Thorough Caution for Low Confidence)
 67 |     *   `Flag for Human Review` (Explicit message to user)
 68 | 
 69 | **3. The ACQA Workflow (Step-by-Step)**
 70 | 
 71 | 1.  **Request:** User -> Commander.
 72 | 2.  **Initial Assessment (Commander):** Analyze request, determine `User Caution Level` (from config).
 73 | 3.  **Task Assignment (Commander -> Developer):** Delegate task with prompt, context (files via `read_file`, specs), and `User Caution Level`.
 74 | 4.  **--- Developer Agent Execution Cycle ---**
 75 |     *   a. **Understand Task:** Process prompt, context.
 76 |     *   b. **Delegate Sub-Task (If Needed):** Act as Coordinator for sub-task (Steps 2-6 recursively). Receive result (artifact + confidence) from sub-agent, analyze feedback (Step 5.e), initiate revisions if needed (Step 5.f), then continue main task.
 77 |     *   c. **Generate/Modify Artifact:** Perform core task.
 78 |     *   d. **Self-Assess Confidence:** Calculate `Confidence Score` (Low/Medium/High) + rationale.
 79 |     *   e. **Package Result:** Bundle artifact, score, rationale.
 80 |     *   f. **Report to Commander:** Send package.
 81 | 5.  **--- QA Decision & Execution Cycle (Commander) ---**
 82 |     *   a. **Receive Result:** Get package from Developer Agent.
 83 |     *   b. **Decision Logic:** Evaluate `Confidence Score` vs. `User Caution Level` to determine required `QA Action(s)`.
 84 |     *   c. **Delegate QA Task (If Triggered):** Assign task to Reviewer/Tester Agent(s) via `new_task`. **Crucially, provide:** artifact, original prompt, **relevant specifications** (read via `read_file`), confidence score, required QA level/checklist.
 85 |     *   d. **Receive QA Feedback:** Get structured feedback from QA Agent(s).
 86 |     *   e. **Critically Analyze Feedback & Detect Patterns:**
 87 |         *   Commander evaluates feedback validity against specs. Is it actionable? Significant? Avoid trivial loops. (May use `second-opinion` if unsure about the feedback itself).
 88 |         *   **Pattern Detection:** Commander tracks QA feedback patterns across recent tasks. If the *same type* of specification deviation or error (e.g., incorrect filename convention, missing required TOML field, wrong path format) is flagged repeatedly (e.g., > 2-3 times), it indicates a potential systemic issue.
 89 |         *   **Escalation for Meta-Review:** If a recurring pattern is detected, Commander should **PAUSE** the revision cycle for that specific error type and **FLAG** the pattern to the user. Instead of just initiating another fix, Commander should propose a meta-review: "Recurring issue X detected, suggesting a potential problem with Spec Y or SOP Step Z. Recommend reviewing/updating the specification/SOP before proceeding with further fixes of this type." (See Adaptive Failure Resolution Process: `.planning/adaptive_failure_resolution_process.md`)
 90 |     *   f. **Initiate Revision (If Needed & No Pattern Escalation):** If changes are required *and* no recurring pattern triggered an escalation, create **Boomerang Task** or re-delegate to original Developer Agent with *specific* revision instructions based on analyzed feedback. Go back to Step 4.a for the Developer Agent.
 91 | 6.  **--- Finalization (Commander) ---**
 92 |     *   g. **Integrate & Finalize:** Once QA passed/skipped and revisions complete, finalize artifact.
 93 |     *   h. **Report to User:** Use `attempt_completion`. Present result, optionally summarizing confidence and QA steps (e.g., "Generated artifact with Medium confidence, reviewed against Spec X by AI.").
 94 | 
 95 | **4. Implementation Considerations**
 96 | 
 97 | *   **Confidence Scoring:** Develop as a core capability/prompt pattern for Developer Agents. Start simple, iterate.
 98 | *   **Agent Prompting:** Update base prompts for Commander, Developer, Reviewer, Tester roles to explicitly include ACQA responsibilities (self-assessment, context provision, structured feedback).
 99 | *   **Configuration:** Define `.roo/project_config.toml` schema for `User Caution Level` and other preferences. Implement reading this config.
100 | *   **Context Passing:** Emphasize Commander's role in using `read_file` to fetch specs/context and passing them explicitly during QA delegation.
101 | *   **Boomerang Tasks:** Leverage for efficient revision cycles.
102 | *   **Transparency:** Design UI/reporting to clearly show ACQA status.
103 | 
104 | **5. Benefits**
105 | 
106 | *   Proactive, adaptive quality gate.
107 | *   Balances speed and assurance via user control.
108 | *   Improves reliability of complex, delegated tasks.
109 | *   Formalizes context-aware review and critical feedback analysis.
110 | *   Creates traceable QA record.
111 | 
112 | **6. Next Steps (Conceptual)**
113 | 
114 | 1.  Develop initial Confidence Scoring heuristics.
115 | 2.  Define standard Reviewer Agent checks for `Balanced` caution.
116 | 3.  Implement `User Caution Level` config reading.
117 | 4.  Update core Agent prompts for ACQA roles.
118 | 5.  Integrate basic ACQA loop (Confidence/Caution check -> QA Delegation with Context -> Feedback Analysis -> Revision Loop) into Commander logic.
119 | 6.  Test and iterate.
120 | 
121 | This refined ACQA proposal provides a robust framework for enhancing quality and reliability within the Roo Code multi-agent system.

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->
</tool_name>

**Assistant:**

You are absolutely correct. A robust workflow should leverage delegation and integrate standard processes like ACQA and PAL where applicable. My previous draft assigned everything to the Coordinator and overlooked these integrations.

I need to understand the other standard processes before revising the workflow. I have read `acqa-process.md`. Now I will read the Automated File Refactoring (AFR) process.

 1 | # Process: Adaptive Failure Resolution (AFR) v1.0
 2 | 
 3 | **Date:** 2025-04-16
 4 | **Status:** Active
 5 | **Related Documents:** `.processes/acqa-process.md` (ACQA)
 6 | 
 7 | ---
 8 | 
 9 | **1. Objective:**
10 | 
11 | To define a structured process for identifying, analyzing, and resolving **recurring failures or specification deviations** detected during the Quality Assurance (QA) phase of delegated tasks, particularly within the ACQA framework. This aims to move beyond repeatedly fixing symptoms and address potential root causes in agent capabilities, instructions, specifications, or SOPs.
12 | 
13 | **2. Trigger:**
14 | 
15 | This process is triggered by the **Coordinator** (e.g., Roo Commander) during the "Critically Analyze Feedback & Detect Patterns" step (ACQA Workflow Step 5.e) when:
16 | 
17 | *   The *same type* of error or deviation from specification is identified by QA agents across multiple, independent task executions (e.g., > 2-3 times recently).
18 | *   Examples: Consistent failure to use correct TOML format, repeated misinterpretation of a specific schema field, incorrect path formatting, failure to handle a specific edge case mentioned in instructions.
19 | 
20 | **3. Process Steps:**
21 | 
22 | 1.  **Identify & Log Pattern (Coordinator):**
23 |     *   Recognize the recurring nature of a specific QA finding.
24 |     *   Log the pattern, noting:
25 |         *   The specific error/deviation type.
26 |         *   The tasks/modes affected.
27 |         *   The relevant specification(s) or SOP step(s) being violated.
28 |         *   Frequency/context of recurrence.
29 | 
30 | 2.  **Pause Symptom Fixes (Coordinator):**
31 |     *   Temporarily halt initiating further revision tasks (`new_task` or Boomerang) aimed *solely* at fixing the specific recurring error in new instances. (Other unrelated fixes can proceed).
32 | 
33 | 3.  **Hypothesize Root Cause(s) (Coordinator):**
34 |     *   Analyze the pattern and context. Potential root causes include:
35 |         *   **Agent Capability/Instructions:** The delegate agent (e.g., `mode-maintainer`) lacks the necessary knowledge or explicit instruction in its core definition or custom instructions.
36 |         *   **Specification Clarity:** The relevant specification document (e.g., Mode Spec, TOML+MD Rule) is ambiguous, incomplete, or potentially incorrect.
37 |         *   **SOP Flaw:** The SOP guiding the task execution or delegation is missing steps, providing insufficient context, or making incorrect assumptions.
38 |         *   **Delegation Error:** The Coordinator's delegation message consistently lacks critical context or instruction, despite the SOP.
39 |         *   **Tooling Issue:** (Less likely for format errors, but possible) A tool used in the process is introducing errors.
40 | 
41 | 4.  **Initiate Meta-Review & Analysis (Coordinator):**
42 |     *   **Action:** Escalate the identified pattern and hypothesized root cause(s) to the **User**.
43 |     *   **Proposal:** Recommend a specific meta-review action based on the hypothesis:
44 |         *   *If Agent Capability suspected:* Propose reviewing and enhancing the specific agent's definition/instructions.
45 |         *   *If Spec Clarity suspected:* Propose reviewing the relevant specification document for ambiguity, potentially involving `technical-writer` or `second-opinion`.
46 |         *   *If SOP Flaw suspected:* Propose applying the Process Assurance Lifecycle (PAL) simulation to the relevant SOP section.
47 |         *   *If Delegation Error suspected:* Propose reviewing the Coordinator's own delegation logic/templates.
48 |     *   **Tool:** Use `ask_followup_question` to present the findings and proposed meta-review action(s) to the user for guidance/approval.
49 | 
50 | 5.  **Execute Meta-Review (Delegated or Coordinated):**
51 |     *   Based on user direction, execute the chosen meta-review action (e.g., delegate spec review to `technical-writer`, enhance agent definition, simulate SOP).
52 | 
53 | 6.  **Implement Process/Agent Improvement:**
54 |     *   Based on the meta-review findings, implement the necessary changes:
55 |         *   Update agent definitions/instructions.
56 |         *   Update specifications or rules.
57 |         *   Update SOPs.
58 |         *   Refine Coordinator delegation templates/logic.
59 | 
60 | 7.  **Validate Improvement (Optional but Recommended):**
61 |     *   Re-run a relevant test case (e.g., re-migrate a problematic mode) using the updated process/agent to confirm the recurring error is resolved. Apply ACQA.
62 | 
63 | 8.  **Resume Normal Operations:**
64 |     *   Remove the pause on fixing the specific error type.
65 |     *   Continue processing tasks using the improved process/agents/specs.
66 | 
67 | **4. Integration with ACQA:**
68 | 
69 | *   AFR is triggered within ACQA's Step 5.e (Analyze Feedback).
70 | *   It acts as an escalation path when simple revision cycles (ACQA Step 5.f) are insufficient due to recurring systemic issues.
71 | 
72 | **5. Benefits:**
73 | 
74 | *   Prevents wasted effort fixing recurring symptoms.
75 | *   Drives improvement of underlying processes, specifications, and agent capabilities.
76 | *   Leverages pattern detection for systemic quality control.
77 | *   Incorporates user guidance in addressing fundamental issues.

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->

**Assistant:**

You are absolutely correct. I apologize for the oversight. A workflow should indeed leverage delegation and integrate established processes for robustness.

I have read the ACQA and AFR process documents. Now, I will read the Project Asset Listing (PAL) process document to understand its role before revising the migration workflow.

 1 | # Process: Process Assurance Lifecycle (PAL) v1.0
 2 | 
 3 | **Date:** 2025-04-16
 4 | 
 5 | **Authors:** Roo Commander, User (Jeremy)
 6 | 
 7 | **Status:** Active
 8 | 
 9 | ---
10 | 
11 | **1. Goal & Scope**
12 | 
13 | *   **Goal:** To establish a standard, iterative process for creating, validating, and maintaining clear, correct, robust, and effective Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) or Workflow documents governing multi-agent activities within the Roo Code system.
14 | *   **Scope:** This lifecycle applies to the creation of new SOPs/Workflows and significant revisions of existing ones, particularly those involving delegation, context management, and quality assurance steps like ACQA.
15 | 
16 | **2. Core Principles**
17 | 
18 | *   **Iteration:** SOPs/Workflows are developed through cycles of drafting, review, simulation, and refinement.
19 | *   **Simulation:** Virtual test runs are used to proactively identify flaws before real-world execution.
20 | *   **Clarity:** Documents must use unambiguous language and clearly define steps, roles, inputs, and outputs.
21 | *   **Fault Tolerance:** Documents should anticipate potential failure points and include error handling or escalation paths.
22 | *   **Context Awareness:** Documents must ensure necessary context (specifications, data, user intent) is available or explicitly passed at each relevant step, especially during delegation.
23 | 
24 | **3. Agent Roles (within PAL)**
25 | 
26 | *   **Author/Owner:** The agent primarily responsible for drafting and maintaining the SOP/Workflow (often Roo Commander or a lead specialist).
27 | *   **Conceptual Reviewer:** An agent tasked with reviewing the draft for clarity, logic, and completeness (e.g., `technical-writer`, `second-opinion`).
28 | *   **Simulator:** The agent performing the virtual test run (usually the Author/Owner).
29 | *   **User:** Provides final approval and guidance on requirements.
30 | 
31 | **4. The PAL Workflow**
32 | 
33 | *   **Phase 1: Drafting**
34 |     1.  **Define Objective & Scope:** Clearly state what process the SOP/Workflow covers and its intended outcome.
35 |     2.  **Identify Actors & Roles:** List the primary agents involved and their responsibilities.
36 |     3.  **Select Template:** Choose the appropriate template (`.templates/toml-md/15_sop.md` for simple processes, `.templates/workflows/00_workflow_boilerplate.md` for complex workflows).
37 |     4.  **Outline Steps:** Draft the initial sequence of actions using the chosen template, including inputs, tools, decision points, outputs, and basic error handling.
38 |     5.  **Store Draft:** Save the initial version in `.planning/` (e.g., `draft-my-process.md`).
39 | 
40 | *   **Phase 2: Conceptual Review**
41 |     1.  **Delegate Review:** Author delegates a review task (`new_task`) to a Conceptual Reviewer. Provide the draft path and objectives.
42 |     2.  **Perform Review:** Reviewer analyzes the draft for clarity, logic, completeness, consistency, and potential contradictions.
43 |     3.  **Provide Feedback:** Reviewer provides structured feedback.
44 |     4.  **Incorporate Feedback:** Author updates the draft SOP/Workflow based on the review.
45 | 
46 | *   **Phase 3: Simulated Execution (Virtual Test Run)**
47 |     1.  **Select Test Case:** Simulator chooses a realistic scenario the SOP/Workflow should handle.
48 |     2.  **Walk Through:** Simulator follows the steps sequentially for the test case.
49 |     3.  **Simulate Actions:**
50 |         *   Assume plausible results for info gathering steps.
51 |         *   Follow logic for decision points based on simulated conditions.
52 |         *   For delegation steps (`new_task`): Formulate the message, critically assess if it includes *all necessary context*, and anticipate potential delegate failures/questions. Check if the SOP/Workflow handles these.
53 |     4.  **Identify Gaps:** Document findings: ambiguities, missing steps, unhandled errors, insufficient context, incorrect assumptions, logical flaws.
54 | 
55 | *   **Phase 4: Refinement**
56 |     1.  **Update Draft:** Author revises the draft based on simulation findings.
57 |     2.  **Iterate:** Repeat Phase 2 (Review) and/or Phase 3 (Simulation) if refinements are significant, until confident.
58 | 
59 | *   **Phase 5: Integration Checks**
60 |     1.  **Cross-Reference:** Ensure alignment with related processes (e.g., ACQA) and specifications.
61 |     2.  **Verify Paths:** Double-check all document paths referenced are correct.
62 | 
63 | *   **Phase 6: Finalization & Deployment**
64 |     1.  **User Approval:** Present the refined SOP/Workflow to the user for final review and approval via `ask_followup_question`.
65 |     2.  **Determine Final Location:** Based on the document type (SOP vs. Workflow) and content, confirm the correct final directory (e.g., `.processes/`, `.workflows/`, `.docs/standards/`).
66 |     3.  **Store Official Version:**
67 |         *   Use `read_file` on the final draft in `.planning/`.
68 |         *   Use `write_to_file` to save the content to the determined official path (e.g., `.processes/pal-process.md`). Ensure correct `line_count`.
69 |     4.  **Cleanup Draft:** Use `execute_command rm` to delete the draft version from `.planning/`.
70 |     5.  **Update Related Docs:** Ensure any documents referencing the SOP/Workflow are updated with the new path if necessary.
71 |     6.  **Internal Knowledge:** (Future) Update internal knowledge base for relevant agents about the new/updated SOP/Workflow.
72 | 
73 | **5. Benefits**
74 | 
75 | *   Reduces errors caused by flawed or ambiguous SOPs/Workflows.
76 | *   Improves reliability by ensuring context is considered during delegation.
77 | *   Builds more robust and fault-tolerant multi-agent workflows.
78 | *   Provides a structured way to iteratively improve operational procedures.
79 | 
80 | **6. Next Steps**
81 | 
82 | *   Adopt PAL as the standard method for developing/refining SOPs/Workflows.
83 | *   Apply PAL retrospectively to the Mode Creation SOP v2 draft.
84 | *   Utilize PAL for developing future SOPs/Workflows.

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->
</tool_name>

**Assistant:**

You are absolutely correct. My apologies for overlooking the importance of delegation and integration with standard processes (ACQA, AFR, PAL) in the previous workflow draft. A workflow should indeed leverage these elements for robustness and align with our established practices.

I have now reviewed the ACQA, AFR, and PAL process documents. I will revise the workflow `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md` to incorporate delegation and appropriate references to these standard processes.

First, I need to read the current content of the workflow file.

<read_file>
<path>.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md</path>
</read_file>

 44 | # Workflow: Migrate Mode from v7.1 to v7.2 Structure
 45 | 
 46 | ## 1. Objective 🎯
 47 | *   To manually migrate a single mode definition from the v7.1 directory structure to the new v7.2 structure, applying updated naming conventions, separating knowledge base (KB) content, creating mode-specific rules, and updating the v7.2 manifest.
 48 | 
 49 | ## 2. Scope ↔️
 50 | *   This workflow applies to each individual mode located within the `v7.1/modes/` directory structure.
 51 | *   It covers file copying, renaming, content modification (TOML ID), directory creation, and manifest updating.
 52 | *   It assumes the naming prefixes and logic are defined (as per ADR-001).
 53 | 
 54 | ## 3. Roles & Responsibilities 👤
 55 | *   **Roo Commander (or designated Migration Agent):** Responsible for executing all steps of this workflow accurately for each mode being migrated.
 56 | 
 57 | ## 4. Preconditions🚦
 58 | *   The v7.1 mode definition file (`v7.1/modes/.../<old-slug>.mode.md`) exists.
 59 | *   `ADR-001_mode_source_reorganisation.md` is approved or accepted as the guiding document.
 60 | *   The logic for determining new slugs and prefixes is defined and understood (can be derived from the `getNewSlugAndPrefix` function in the previously created script `.dev_tools/v7.2/build_dev_v7.2.js`).
 61 | *   The target root directories (`v7.2/` and `.roo/rules/`) exist.
 62 | *   The manifest file `v7.2/manifest.toml` exists (or will be created during the first mode migration).
 63 | 
 64 | ## 5. Reference Documents & Tools 📚🛠️
 65 | *   `.decisions/ADR-001_mode_source_reorganisation.md`
 66 | *   `.docs/roo-code/custom-modes.md`
 67 | *   `.docs/roo-code/custom-instructions.md`
 68 | *   Logic within `.dev_tools/v7.2/build_dev_v7.2.js` (specifically `getNewSlugAndPrefix` function) for naming conventions.
 69 | *   **Tools:** `list_files`, `read_file`, `write_to_file`, `apply_diff` (optional, for manifest update).
 70 | 
 71 | ## 6. Workflow Steps 🪜
 72 | 
 73 | *   **Step 1: Select Mode & Identify Paths (Coordinator Task)**
 74 |     *   **Description:** Choose the next v7.1 mode to migrate. Identify its source `.mode.md` file path and the path to its `custom-instructions` directory (if it exists).
 75 |     *   **Inputs:** Knowledge of which modes in `v7.1/modes/` need migration.
 76 |     *   **Procedure:** Use `list_files` on `v7.1/modes/` (recursively if needed) to locate the mode. Note the full path to `<old-slug>.mode.md` and `custom-instructions/`.
 77 |     *   **Outputs:** `source_mode_file_path`, `source_ci_dir_path` (can be null).
 78 |     *   **Error Handling:** If source file not found, stop workflow for this mode and log error.
 79 | 
 80 | *   **Step 2: Read Source Mode Definition (Coordinator Task)**
 81 |     *   **Description:** Read the content of the source `.mode.md` file.
 82 |     *   **Inputs:** `source_mode_file_path`.
 83 |     *   **Procedure:** Use `read_file` tool.
 84 |     *   **Outputs:** `source_mode_content`.
 85 |     *   **Error Handling:** If read fails, stop workflow for this mode and log error.
 86 | 
 87 | *   **Step 3: Extract TOML & Validate (Coordinator Task)**
 88 |     *   **Description:** Extract the TOML frontmatter from the source content and validate required fields (`id`, `name`, `system_prompt`). Verify `id` matches the old slug derived from the filename.
 89 |     *   **Inputs:** `source_mode_content`.
 90 |     *   **Procedure:** Parse TOML (internal logic). Check for required fields. Compare `id` with filename slug.
 91 |     *   **Outputs:** Parsed `toml_data`, `old_slug`.
 92 |     *   **Error Handling:** If TOML is missing, invalid, or validation fails, stop workflow for this mode and log error.
 93 | 
 94 | *   **Step 4: Determine New Slug & Paths (Coordinator Task)**
 95 |     *   **Description:** Apply the defined naming logic (based on source path and old slug) to determine the `new_slug` and `prefix`. Define all target paths.
 96 |     *   **Inputs:** `source_mode_file_path`, `old_slug`.
 97 |     *   **Procedure:** Apply naming logic (referencing `getNewSlugAndPrefix` concept). Construct target paths: `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_mode_file_path`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`, `target_kb_rule_file`.
 98 |     *   **Outputs:** `new_slug`, `prefix`, all target paths.
 99 |     *   **Error Handling:** If new slug cannot be determined, stop workflow for this mode and log error.
100 | 
101 | *   **Step 5: Create Target Directories (Coordinator Task)**
102 |     *   **Description:** Create the necessary target directories for the mode in `v7.2/` and `.roo/rules/`.
103 |     *   **Inputs:** `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`.
104 |     *   **Procedure:** Use `write_to_file` to create a dummy file (e.g., `.placeholder`) in each directory to ensure creation. Alternatively, use `execute_command` with `mkdir -p`. *Using `write_to_file` is generally safer.*
105 |         *   `write_to_file` path=`${target_v72_mode_dir}/.placeholder` content="" line_count=0
106 |         *   `write_to_file` path=`${target_kb_dir}/.placeholder` content="" line_count=0
107 |         *   `write_to_file` path=`${target_rules_dir}/.placeholder` content="" line_count=0
108 |     *   **Outputs:** Confirmation of directory creation (implicit via tool success).
109 |     *   **Error Handling:** If directory creation fails, stop workflow and log error.
110 | 
111 | *   **Step 6: Copy & Modify Mode Definition (Coordinator Task)**
112 |     *   **Description:** Copy the source mode content to the new location, renaming the file and updating the `id` field within the TOML frontmatter.
113 |     *   **Inputs:** `source_mode_content`, `old_slug`, `new_slug`, `target_mode_file_path`.
114 |     *   **Procedure:**
115 |         1.  Modify `source_mode_content` in memory: Replace `id = "<old_slug>"` with `id = "<new_slug>"`. Be precise with the replacement.
116 |         2.  Use `write_to_file` with the modified content and `target_mode_file_path`.
117 |     *   **Outputs:** New mode definition file created at `target_mode_file_path`.
118 |     *   **Error Handling:** If write fails, stop workflow and log error. Verify the `id` was actually changed by reading the new file back.
119 | 
120 | *   **Step 7: Migrate KB Content (Coordinator Task)**
121 |     *   **Description:** Copy all files and subdirectories from the source `custom-instructions` directory (if it exists) to the target `kb` directory.
122 |     *   **Inputs:** `source_ci_dir_path`, `target_kb_dir`.
123 |     *   **Procedure:**
124 |         1.  Check if `source_ci_dir_path` exists and is not null.
125 |         2.  If it exists, use `list_files` (recursive: true) on `source_ci_dir_path`.
126 |         3.  For each file found:
127 |             *   Use `read_file` to get its content.
128 |             *   Construct the corresponding path within `target_kb_dir`.
129 |             *   Use `write_to_file` to write the content to the target path.
130 |         4.  If `source_ci_dir_path` does not exist, skip this step.
131 |     *   **Outputs:** KB content replicated in `target_kb_dir`.
132 |     *   **Error Handling:** Log errors if reading or writing individual KB files fails, but attempt to continue with other files.
133 | 
134 | *   **Step 8: Create KB Lookup Rule (Coordinator Task)**
135 |     *   **Description:** Create the standard KB lookup rule file within the mode's specific rules directory.
136 |     *   **Inputs:** `target_kb_rule_file`, `new_slug`.
137 |     *   **Procedure:**
138 |         1.  Prepare the rule content, injecting the `new_slug` into the placeholder path.
139 |         2.  Use `write_to_file` to create `target_kb_rule_file` with the prepared content.
140 |     *   **Outputs:** KB lookup rule file created.
141 |     *   **Error Handling:** If write fails, stop workflow and log error.
142 | 
143 | *   **Step 9: Update Manifest File (Coordinator Task)**
144 |     *   **Description:** Add or update the entry for the migrated mode in `v7.2/manifest.toml`.
145 |     *   **Inputs:** `new_slug`, `prefix`, `toml_data.name`, `toml_data.system_prompt`, `source_mode_file_path`, `target_mode_file_path`, `target_rules_dir`, `toml_data.tags` (optional).
146 |     *   **Procedure:**
147 |         1.  Use `read_file` to get the current content of `v7.2/manifest.toml`. If it doesn't exist or read fails, start with an empty TOML structure (`{ modes: {} }`).
148 |         2.  Parse the TOML content (internal logic or using `@iarna/toml` if available via a tool/script).
149 |         3.  Create/update the entry `manifest_data.modes[new_slug]` with the required fields (slug, name, prefix, role_definition, source_path_v7_1, path_v7_2, rules_path, tags). Ensure paths are relative to the workspace root and use forward slashes.
150 |         4.  Stringify the updated manifest data back into TOML format.
151 |         5.  Use `write_to_file` to save the updated content back to `v7.2/manifest.toml`.
152 |     *   **Outputs:** Updated `v7.2/manifest.toml`.
153 |     *   **Error Handling:** If reading, parsing, stringifying, or writing the manifest fails, stop workflow and log error. Consider backup/restore mechanisms for the manifest.
154 | 
155 | *   **Step 10: Verification (Coordinator Task)**
156 |     *   **Description:** Perform basic checks to verify the migration steps were successful.
157 |     *   **Inputs:** All target paths, `new_slug`.
158 |     *   **Procedure:**
159 |         *   Use `list_files` on `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir` to confirm existence and expected files (`<new-slug>.mode.md`, KB files, `01-kb-lookup-rule.md`).
160 |         *   Use `read_file` on `target_mode_file_path` and verify the `id` in the TOML matches `new_slug`.
161 |         *   Use `read_file` on `v7.2/manifest.toml` and verify the entry for `new_slug` exists and is correct.
162 |     *   **Outputs:** Confirmation of successful migration for this mode or list of verification failures.
163 |     *   **Error Handling:** Log any verification failures. Manual intervention may be required.
164 | 
165 | ## 7. Postconditions ✅
166 | *   The migrated mode exists in the `v7.2/` directory with the new naming convention and structure.
167 | *   The mode's KB content is located in `v7.2/<new-slug>/kb/`.
168 | *   The mode definition file (`.mode.md`) has its internal TOML `id` updated to `new_slug`.
169 | *   The mode-specific rules directory (`.roo/rules/<new-slug>/`) exists and contains the KB lookup rule.

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->
</tool_name>

**Assistant:**

You are absolutely correct. My apologies for the oversight in the previous draft. A workflow should indeed leverage delegation and integrate established processes for robustness.

I have now reviewed the ACQA, AFR, and PAL process documents. I will revise the workflow `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md` to incorporate appropriate delegation and references to these standard processes.

# Workflow: Migrate Mode from v7.1 to v7.2 Structure (v1.1)

## 1. Objective 🎯
*   To migrate a single mode definition from the v7.1 directory structure to the new v7.2 structure, applying updated naming conventions, separating knowledge base (KB) content, creating mode-specific rules, and updating the v7.2 manifest, utilizing delegation for file operations and verification.

## 2. Scope ↔️
*   This workflow applies to each individual mode located within the `v7.1/modes/` directory structure.
*   It covers identifying source files, determining new structure/naming, delegating file creation/modification/copying tasks, delegating verification, and updating the central manifest.
*   It assumes the naming prefixes and logic are defined (as per ADR-001).

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities 👤
*   **Coordinator (Roo Commander):** Orchestrates the workflow, selects modes, gathers initial info, determines naming/paths, delegates tasks, handles manifest updates, manages errors, and reports final status.
*   **Worker Agent (e.g., `mode-maintainer`):** Executes delegated tasks involving file/directory creation, copying, and modification using tools like `write_to_file`, `read_file`, `list_files`. Reports success or failure.
*   **Verification Agent (e.g., `code-reviewer`):** Executes delegated verification tasks using tools like `read_file`, `list_files` to check if the migration steps were performed correctly. Reports findings.

## 4. Preconditions🚦
*   The v7.1 mode definition file (`v7.1/modes/.../<old-slug>.mode.md`) exists.
*   `ADR-001_mode_source_reorganisation.md` is approved or accepted.
*   Naming logic (e.g., `getNewSlugAndPrefix` concept) is understood by the Coordinator.
*   Target root directories (`v7.2/` and `.roo/rules/`) exist.
*   Manifest file `v7.2/manifest.toml` exists (or will be created/handled in Step 9).
*   Appropriate Worker and Verification agents are available.

## 5. Reference Documents & Tools 📚🛠️
*   `.decisions/ADR-001_mode_source_reorganisation.md`
*   `.docs/roo-code/custom-modes.md`
*   `.docs/roo-code/custom-instructions.md`
*   `.processes/acqa-process.md` (for verification step principles)
*   `.processes/afr-process.md` (for overall error handling)
*   `.processes/pal-process.md` (for validating this workflow itself)
*   Logic within `.dev_tools/v7.2/build_dev_v7.2.js` (for naming conventions).
*   **Coordinator Tools:** `list_files`, `read_file`, `new_task`, `write_to_file` (for manifest), `apply_diff` (optional for manifest).
*   **Worker Agent Tools:** `write_to_file`, `read_file`, `list_files`.
*   **Verification Agent Tools:** `read_file`, `list_files`.

## 6. Workflow Steps 🪜

*   **Step 1: Select Mode & Identify Paths (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Choose the next v7.1 mode to migrate. Identify its source `.mode.md` file path and the path to its `custom-instructions` directory (if it exists).
    *   **Inputs:** List of modes in `v7.1/modes/` needing migration.
    *   **Procedure:** Use `list_files` on `v7.1/modes/` (recursively) to locate the mode. Note the full path to `<old-slug>.mode.md` and `custom-instructions/`.
    *   **Outputs:** `source_mode_file_path`, `source_ci_dir_path` (can be null).
    *   **Error Handling:** If source file not found, stop workflow for this mode and log error.

*   **Step 2: Read Source Mode Definition (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Read the content of the source `.mode.md` file.
    *   **Inputs:** `source_mode_file_path`.
    *   **Procedure:** Use `read_file` tool.
    *   **Outputs:** `source_mode_content`.
    *   **Error Handling:** If read fails, stop workflow for this mode and log error.

*   **Step 3: Extract TOML & Validate (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Extract the TOML frontmatter from the source content and validate required fields (`id`, `name`, `system_prompt`). Verify `id` matches the old slug derived from the filename.
    *   **Inputs:** `source_mode_content`.
    *   **Procedure:** Parse TOML (internal logic). Check for required fields. Compare `id` with filename slug.
    *   **Outputs:** Parsed `toml_data`, `old_slug`.
    *   **Error Handling:** If TOML is missing, invalid, or validation fails, stop workflow for this mode and log error.

*   **Step 4: Determine New Slug & Paths (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Apply the defined naming logic (based on source path and old slug) to determine the `new_slug` and `prefix`. Define all target paths.
    *   **Inputs:** `source_mode_file_path`, `old_slug`.
    *   **Procedure:** Apply naming logic (referencing `getNewSlugAndPrefix` concept). Construct target paths: `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_mode_file_path`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`, `target_kb_rule_file`.
    *   **Outputs:** `new_slug`, `prefix`, all target paths.
    *   **Error Handling:** If new slug cannot be determined or is invalid, stop workflow for this mode and log error.

*   **Step 5: Delegate Directory Creation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Ensure the necessary target directories for the mode exist in `v7.2/` and `.roo/rules/`.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`.
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
        *   "Ensure the following directories exist. Use `write_to_file` to create a `.placeholder` file within each to guarantee creation if they don't exist."
        *   "Directory 1: `{target_v72_mode_dir}`"
        *   "Directory 2: `{target_kb_dir}`"
        *   "Directory 3: `{target_rules_dir}`"
        *   "Report success or any errors encountered."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow and log. If successful, proceed to Step 6.
    *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors reported by delegate. May trigger AFR if this step fails repeatedly across modes.

*   **Step 6: Delegate Mode Definition Migration (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Copy the source mode content to the new location, renaming the file and updating the `id` field within the TOML frontmatter.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `source_mode_content`, `old_slug`, `new_slug`, `target_mode_file_path`.
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
        *   "Take the provided source content."
        *   "Modify the content: Find the line starting with `id = \"{old_slug}\"` in the TOML frontmatter and change it to `id = \"{new_slug}\"`."
        *   "Use `write_to_file` to save this *modified* content to the path: `{target_mode_file_path}`."
        *   "Report success or any errors encountered during modification or writing."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow and log. If successful, proceed to Step 7.
    *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. Failure here is critical. May trigger AFR.

*   **Step 7: Delegate KB Content Migration (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Copy all files and subdirectories from the source `custom-instructions` directory (if it exists) to the target `kb` directory.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `source_ci_dir_path` (if not null), `target_kb_dir`.
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
        *   "If the source path `{source_ci_dir_path}` was provided:"
        *   "Use `list_files` (recursive: true) to find all files within `{source_ci_dir_path}`."
        *   "For each source file found:"
        *   "Use `read_file` to get its content."
        *   "Determine the corresponding target path within `{target_kb_dir}` (maintaining the relative subdirectory structure)."
        *   "Use `write_to_file` to save the content to the target path."
        *   "Report success or list any files that failed to copy."
        *   "If the source path was not provided, report success immediately."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of file copy errors.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. Log any reported file copy errors (non-critical). Proceed to Step 8.
    *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. Failure to copy individual KB files is usually non-critical but should be noted.

*   **Step 8: Delegate KB Rule Creation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Create the standard KB lookup rule file within the mode's specific rules directory.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `target_kb_rule_file`, `new_slug`. Template content for the rule (from workflow definition).
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
        *   "Take the provided rule template content."
        *   "Replace the placeholder `<your-mode-slug>` with the actual slug: `{new_slug}`."
        *   "Use `write_to_file` to save this content to the path: `{target_kb_rule_file}`."
        *   "Report success or any errors."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow and log. If successful, proceed to Step 9.
    *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. Failure here is critical.

*   **Step 9: Update Manifest File (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Add or update the entry for the migrated mode in `v7.2/manifest.toml`.
    *   **Inputs:** `new_slug`, `prefix`, `toml_data.name`, `toml_data.system_prompt`, `source_mode_file_path`, `target_mode_file_path`, `target_rules_dir`, `toml_data.tags` (optional).
    *   **Procedure:**
        1.  Use `read_file` to get the current content of `v7.2/manifest.toml`. Handle file-not-found by starting with an empty structure.
        2.  Parse TOML (internal logic).
        3.  Create/update `manifest_data.modes[new_slug]` entry. Ensure paths are relative and use forward slashes. Ensure tags are unique.
        4.  Stringify back to TOML.
        5.  Use `write_to_file` to save back to `v7.2/manifest.toml`.
    *   **Outputs:** Updated `v7.2/manifest.toml`.
    *   **Error Handling:** If any part fails, stop workflow, log error. Consider manual recovery or backup/restore for the manifest. Failure here is critical.

*   **Step 10: Delegate Verification (Coordinator delegates to Verification Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Perform checks to verify the migration steps were successful. Aligns with ACQA principles.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`, `target_mode_file_path`, `target_kb_rule_file`, `new_slug`, `source_ci_dir_path` (to check if KB migration was expected). List of expected checks (see procedure below).
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (Verification Agent):**
        *   "Verify the successful migration of mode `{new_slug}` according to these checks:"
        *   "1. Use `list_files` on `{target_v72_mode_dir}`. Does the file `{new_slug}.mode.md` exist?"
        *   "2. Use `list_files` on `{target_rules_dir}`. Does the file `01-kb-lookup-rule.md` exist?"
        *   "3. Use `read_file` on `{target_mode_file_path}`. Does the TOML frontmatter contain `id = \"{new_slug}\"`?"
        *   "4. (If `{source_ci_dir_path}` was provided) Use `list_files` on `{target_kb_dir}`. Does it contain files? (Basic check, assumes source had files)."
        *   "5. Use `read_file` on `{target_kb_rule_file}`. Does it contain the path `v7.2/{new_slug}/kb/`?"
        *   "Report the outcome (Success/Failure) and list any specific checks that failed."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Verification result (Success/Failure) and details of any failures.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for verification report. If Success, proceed to Step 11. If Failure, log details, stop workflow for this mode, and potentially initiate manual review or rollback.
    *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs verification failures. May trigger AFR if verification fails consistently in the same way across modes.

*   **Step 11: Final Report (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Report the final status of the migration for this mode to the user.
    *   **Inputs:** Outcome of Step 10.
    *   **Procedure:** Use `attempt_completion` (if this is the only mode) or log status (if part of a larger batch) indicating success or failure for the specific mode migration.
    *   **Outputs:** User informed of migration status for the mode.

## 7. Postconditions ✅
*   The migrated mode exists in the `v7.2/` directory with the new naming convention and structure.
*   The mode's KB content is located in `v7.2/<new-slug>/kb/`.
*   The mode definition file (`.mode.md`) has its internal TOML `id` updated to `new_slug`.
*   The mode-specific rules directory (`.roo/rules/<new-slug>/`) exists and contains the KB lookup rule.
*   The `v7.2/manifest.toml` file accurately reflects the migrated mode's details.
*   Verification Agent has confirmed the successful execution of migration steps.

## 8. Error Handling & Escalation (Overall) ⚠️
*   Log all errors encountered during the process for a specific mode.
*   If a critical step delegated to a Worker Agent fails, the Coordinator should log the failure and stop the workflow for that mode.
*   If the Verification Agent reports failures, the Coordinator should log the details and stop the workflow for that mode.
*   **AFR Trigger:** If the *same type* of failure (e.g., Worker failing to update TOML ID, Verification failing the same check) occurs repeatedly across *multiple mode migrations*, the Coordinator should trigger the Adaptive Failure Resolution process (`.processes/afr-process.md`) by pausing the migration for that error type and escalating to the user to investigate the root cause (e.g., flaw in this workflow, issue with worker agent capability, problem with naming logic).
*   Persistent or critical failures should be escalated to the user for manual investigation.

## 9. PAL Validation Record 🧪
*   Date Validated: (Not yet validated)
*   Method: (To be determined - likely Conceptual Review and Simulation as per `.processes/pal-process.md`)
*   Test Case(s): (e.g., Migrate `core-code`, Migrate `dev-fastapi`, Migrate a mode with no `custom-instructions`)
*   Findings/Refinements: (To be added after PAL execution)

## 10. Revision History 📜
*   v1.1 (2025-04-18): Revised to incorporate delegation to Worker and Verification Agents, added references to ACQA, AFR, PAL processes. Clarified roles and error handling.
*   v1.0 (2025-04-18): Initial draft (Coordinator-centric).

# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->
</tool_name>

**Assistant:**

Okay, the revised workflow document `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md` has been successfully created.

This updated workflow addresses your feedback by:
*   Assigning specific file operation tasks (directory creation, file copying/modification) to a designated Worker Agent.
*   Including a dedicated verification step delegated to a Verification Agent.
*   Referencing the standard ACQA, AFR, and PAL processes where appropriate, particularly for verification principles and overall error handling/escalation.

This provides a more robust, delegation-based process for manually migrating each mode according to the plan in `ADR-001`.

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I have revised the workflow for migrating modes from the v7.1 to the v7.2 structure, incorporating your feedback. The updated workflow, located at `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md`, now includes delegation to appropriate Worker and Verification agents and references standard processes like ACQA and AFR. This provides a detailed, step-by-step manual process for the migration, aligning with the decisions in `ADR-001_mode_source_reorganisation.md`.

The user has provided feedback on the results. Consider their input to continue the task, and then attempt completion again.
<feedback>
i still think there is too much file reading work being done as coordinator, every file read fills up context, look at the steps and decide how more can be delegated?

**Assistant:**

You've made an excellent point. As the Coordinator, my primary role is orchestration and decision-making, not performing extensive file I/O that consumes valuable context. We should delegate as much of the file reading and manipulation as possible.

Let's revise the workflow `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md` again to push more work, especially file reading and manifest handling, onto the Worker Agent.

**Proposed Changes:**

1.  **Combine Steps 2 & 3 (Read Source & Validate TOML):** Delegate this to a Worker Agent. The agent will read the source file, extract and validate the TOML, and return the necessary data (`toml_data`, `old_slug`).
2.  **Delegate Step 9 (Update Manifest File):** Delegate the entire read-modify-write cycle for the `manifest.toml` file to a Worker Agent. The Coordinator will provide the *data* for the new entry, and the Worker will handle the file operations and TOML manipulation.

I will now read the current workflow file again to apply these revisions.

 91 | 
 92 | ## 6. Workflow Steps 🪜
 93 | 
 94 | *   **Step 1: Select Mode & Identify Paths (Coordinator Task)**
 95 |     *   **Description:** Choose the next v7.1 mode to migrate. Identify its source `.mode.md` file path and the path to its `custom-instructions` directory (if it exists).
 96 |     *   **Inputs:** List of modes in `v7.1/modes/` needing migration.
 97 |     *   **Procedure:** Use `list_files` on `v7.1/modes/` (recursively) to locate the mode. Note the full path to `<old-slug>.mode.md` and `custom-instructions/`.
 98 |     *   **Outputs:** `source_mode_file_path`, `source_ci_dir_path` (can be null).
 99 |     *   **Error Handling:** If source file not found, stop workflow for this mode and log error.
100 | 
101 | *   **Step 2: Read Source Mode Definition (Coordinator Task)**
102 |     *   **Description:** Read the content of the source `.mode.md` file.
103 |     *   **Inputs:** `source_mode_file_path`.
104 |     *   **Procedure:** Use `read_file` tool.
105 |     *   **Outputs:** `source_mode_content`.
106 |     *   **Error Handling:** If read fails, stop workflow for this mode and log error.
107 | 
108 | *   **Step 3: Extract TOML & Validate (Coordinator Task)**
109 |     *   **Description:** Extract the TOML frontmatter from the source content and validate required fields (`id`, `name`, `system_prompt`). Verify `id` matches the old slug derived from the filename.
110 |     *   **Inputs:** `source_mode_content`.
111 |     *   **Procedure:** Parse TOML (internal logic). Check for required fields. Compare `id` with filename slug.
112 |     *   **Outputs:** Parsed `toml_data`, `old_slug`.
113 |     *   **Error Handling:** If TOML is missing, invalid, or validation fails, stop workflow for this mode and log error.
114 | 
115 | *   **Step 4: Determine New Slug & Paths (Coordinator Task)**
116 |     *   **Description:** Apply the defined naming logic (based on source path and old slug) to determine the `new_slug` and `prefix`. Define all target paths.
117 |     *   **Inputs:** `source_mode_file_path`, `old_slug`.
118 |     *   **Procedure:** Apply naming logic (referencing `getNewSlugAndPrefix` concept). Construct target paths: `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_mode_file_path`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`, `target_kb_rule_file`.
119 |     *   **Outputs:** `new_slug`, `prefix`, all target paths.
120 |     *   **Error Handling:** If new slug cannot be determined or is invalid, stop workflow for this mode and log error.
121 | 
122 | *   **Step 5: Delegate Directory Creation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
123 |     *   **Description:** Ensure the necessary target directories for the mode exist in `v7.2/` and `.roo/rules/`.
124 |     *   **Tool:** `new_task`
125 |     *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`.
126 |     *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
127 |         *   "Ensure the following directories exist. Use `write_to_file` to create a `.placeholder` file within each to guarantee creation if they don't exist."
128 |         *   "Directory 1: `{target_v72_mode_dir}`"
129 |         *   "Directory 2: `{target_kb_dir}`"
130 |         *   "Directory 3: `{target_rules_dir}`"
131 |         *   "Report success or any errors encountered."
132 |     *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
133 |     *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow and log. If successful, proceed to Step 6.
134 |     *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors reported by delegate. May trigger AFR if this step fails repeatedly across modes.
135 | 
136 | *   **Step 6: Delegate Mode Definition Migration (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
137 |     *   **Description:** Copy the source mode content to the new location, renaming the file and updating the `id` field within the TOML frontmatter.
138 |     *   **Tool:** `new_task`
139 |     *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `source_mode_content`, `old_slug`, `new_slug`, `target_mode_file_path`.
140 |     *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
141 |         *   "Take the provided source content."
142 |         *   "Modify the content: Find the line starting with `id = \"{old_slug}\"` in the TOML frontmatter and change it to `id = \"{new_slug}\"`."
143 |         *   "Use `write_to_file` to save this *modified* content to the path: `{target_mode_file_path}`."
144 |         *   "Report success or any errors encountered during modification or writing."
145 |     *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
146 |     *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow and log. If successful, proceed to Step 7.
147 |     *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. Failure here is critical. May trigger AFR.
148 | 
149 | *   **Step 7: Delegate KB Content Migration (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
150 |     *   **Description:** Copy all files and subdirectories from the source `custom-instructions` directory (if it exists) to the target `kb` directory.
151 |     *   **Tool:** `new_task`
152 |     *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `source_ci_dir_path` (if not null), `target_kb_dir`.
153 |     *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
154 |         *   "If the source path `{source_ci_dir_path}` was provided:"
155 |         *   "Use `list_files` (recursive: true) to find all files within `{source_ci_dir_path}`."
156 |         *   "For each source file found:"
157 |         *   "Use `read_file` to get its content."
158 |         *   "Determine the corresponding target path within `{target_kb_dir}` (maintaining the relative subdirectory structure)."
159 |         *   "Use `write_to_file` to save the content to the target path."
160 |         *   "Report success or list any files that failed to copy."
161 |         *   "If the source path was not provided, report success immediately."
162 |     *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of file copy errors.
163 |     *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. Log any reported file copy errors (non-critical). Proceed to Step 8.
164 |     *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. Failure to copy individual KB files is usually non-critical but should be noted.
165 | 
166 | *   **Step 8: Delegate KB Rule Creation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
167 |     *   **Description:** Create the standard KB lookup rule file within the mode's specific rules directory.
168 |     *   **Tool:** `new_task`
169 |     *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `target_kb_rule_file`, `new_slug`. Template content for the rule (from workflow definition).
170 |     *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
171 |         *   "Take the provided rule template content."
172 |         *   "Replace the placeholder `<your-mode-slug>` with the actual slug: `{new_slug}`."
173 |         *   "Use `write_to_file` to save this content to the path: `{target_kb_rule_file}`."
174 |         *   "Report success or any errors."
175 |     *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
176 |     *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow and log. If successful, proceed to Step 9.
177 |     *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. Failure here is critical.
178 | 
179 | *   **Step 9: Update Manifest File (Coordinator Task)**
180 |     *   **Description:** Add or update the entry for the migrated mode in `v7.2/manifest.toml`.
181 |     *   **Inputs:** `new_slug`, `prefix`, `toml_data.name`, `toml_data.system_prompt`, `source_mode_file_path`, `target_mode_file_path`, `target_rules_dir`, `toml_data.tags` (optional).
182 |     *   **Procedure:**
183 |         1.  Use `read_file` to get the current content of `v7.2/manifest.toml`. Handle file-not-found by starting with an empty structure.
184 |         2.  Parse TOML (internal logic).
185 |         3.  Create/update `manifest_data.modes[new_slug]` entry. Ensure paths are relative and use forward slashes. Ensure tags are unique.
186 |         4.  Stringify back to TOML.
187 |         5.  Use `write_to_file` to save back to `v7.2/manifest.toml`.
188 |     *   **Outputs:** Updated `v7.2/manifest.toml`.
189 |     *   **Error Handling:** If any part fails, stop workflow, log error. Consider manual recovery or backup/restore for the manifest. Failure here is critical.
190 | 
191 | *   **Step 10: Delegate Verification (Coordinator delegates to Verification Agent)**
192 |     *   **Description:** Perform checks to verify the migration steps were successful. Aligns with ACQA principles.
193 |     *   **Tool:** `new_task`
194 |     *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`, `target_mode_file_path`, `target_kb_rule_file`, `new_slug`, `source_ci_dir_path` (to check if KB migration was expected). List of expected checks (see procedure below).
195 |     *   **Instructions for Delegate (Verification Agent):**
196 |         *   "Verify the successful migration of mode `{new_slug}` according to these checks:"
197 |         *   "1. Use `list_files` on `{target_v72_mode_dir}`. Does the file `{new_slug}.mode.md` exist?"
198 |         *   "2. Use `list_files` on `{target_rules_dir}`. Does the file `01-kb-lookup-rule.md` exist?"
199 |         *   "3. Use `read_file` on `{target_mode_file_path}`. Does the TOML frontmatter contain `id = \"{new_slug}\"`?"
200 |         *   "4. (If `{source_ci_dir_path}` was provided) Use `list_files` on `{target_kb_dir}`. Does it contain files? (Basic check, assumes source had files)."
201 |         *   "5. Use `read_file` on `{target_kb_rule_file}`. Does it contain the path `v7.2/{new_slug}/kb/`?"
202 |         *   "Report the outcome (Success/Failure) and list any specific checks that failed."
203 |     *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Verification result (Success/Failure) and details of any failures.
204 |     *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for verification report. If Success, proceed to Step 11. If Failure, log details, stop workflow for this mode, and potentially initiate manual review or rollback.
205 |     *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs verification failures. May trigger AFR if verification fails consistently in the same way across modes.
206 | 
207 | *   **Step 11: Final Report (Coordinator Task)**
208 |     *   **Description:** Report the final status of the migration for this mode to the user.
209 |     *   **Inputs:** Outcome of Step 10.
210 |     *   **Procedure:** Use `attempt_completion` (if this is the only mode) or log status (if part of a larger batch) indicating success or failure for the specific mode migration.
211 |     *   **Outputs:** User informed of migration status for the mode.
212 | 
213 | ## 7. Postconditions ✅
214 | *   The migrated mode exists in the `v7.2/` directory with the new naming convention and structure.
215 | *   The mode's KB content is located in `v7.2/<new-slug>/kb/`.
216 | *   The mode definition file (`.mode.md`) has its internal TOML `id` updated to `new_slug`.
217 | *   The mode-specific rules directory (`.roo/rules/<new-slug>/`) exists and contains the KB lookup rule.
218 | *   The `v7.2/manifest.toml` file accurately reflects the migrated mode's details.
219 | *   Verification Agent has confirmed the successful execution of migration steps.
220 | 
221 | ## 8. Error Handling & Escalation (Overall) ⚠️
222 | *   Log all errors encountered during the process for a specific mode.
223 | *   If a critical step delegated to a Worker Agent fails, the Coordinator should log the failure and stop the workflow for that mode.
224 | *   If the Verification Agent reports failures, the Coordinator should log the details and stop the workflow for that mode.
225 | *   **AFR Trigger:** If the *same type* of failure (e.g., Worker failing to update TOML ID, Verification failing the same check) occurs repeatedly across *multiple mode migrations*, the Coordinator should trigger the Adaptive Failure Resolution process (`.processes/afr-process.md`) by pausing the migration for that error type and escalating to the user to investigate the root cause (e.g., flaw in this workflow, issue with worker agent capability, problem with naming logic).
226 | *   Persistent or critical failures should be escalated to the user for manual investigation.
227 | 
228 | ## 9. PAL Validation Record 🧪
229 | *   Date Validated: (Not yet validated)
230 | *   Method: (To be determined - likely Conceptual Review and Simulation as per `.processes/pal-process.md`)
231 | *   Test Case(s): (e.g., Migrate `core-code`, Migrate `dev-fastapi`, Migrate a mode with no `custom-instructions`)
232 | *   Findings/Refinements: (To be added after PAL execution)
233 | 
234 | ## 10. Revision History 📜
235 | *   v1.1 (2025-04-18): Revised to incorporate delegation to Worker and Verification Agents, added references to ACQA, AFR, PAL processes. Clarified roles and error handling.
236 | *   v1.0 (2025-04-18): Initial draft (Coordinator-centric).

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->
</tool_name>

**Assistant:**

You are absolutely right. My apologies for not pushing the delegation far enough in the previous revision. Reading and manipulating the manifest file, in particular, is a task perfectly suited for a Worker Agent to minimize context usage for the Coordinator.

Let's refine the workflow `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md` further.

**Key Changes:**

1.  **Delegate Source File Reading & TOML Validation:** Steps 2 and 3 will be combined into a single delegated task for a Worker Agent.
2.  **Delegate Manifest Update:** Step 9 will be entirely delegated to a Worker Agent, who will handle reading, parsing, updating, and writing the `manifest.toml` file based on data provided by the Coordinator.

I will now apply these changes to the workflow document.

# Workflow: Migrate Mode from v7.1 to v7.2 Structure (v1.2)

## 1. Objective 🎯
*   To migrate a single mode definition from the v7.1 directory structure to the new v7.2 structure, applying updated naming conventions, separating knowledge base (KB) content, creating mode-specific rules, and updating the v7.2 manifest, maximizing delegation of file operations to minimize Coordinator context usage.

## 2. Scope ↔️
*   This workflow applies to each individual mode located within the `v7.1/modes/` directory structure.
*   It covers identifying source files, determining new structure/naming, delegating file reading, validation, creation/modification/copying tasks, delegating verification, and delegating manifest updates.
*   It assumes the naming prefixes and logic are defined (as per ADR-001).

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities 👤
*   **Coordinator (Roo Commander):** Orchestrates the workflow, selects modes, determines naming/paths, delegates tasks with necessary inputs, manages errors, and reports final status. Avoids direct file reading/writing where possible.
*   **Worker Agent (e.g., `mode-maintainer`, `toml-specialist`):** Executes delegated tasks involving file/directory I/O, TOML parsing/manipulation, and content modification. Requires tools like `write_to_file`, `read_file`, `list_files`. Reports success, failure, or extracted data.
*   **Verification Agent (e.g., `code-reviewer`):** Executes delegated verification tasks using tools like `read_file`, `list_files`. Reports findings.

## 4. Preconditions🚦
*   The v7.1 mode definition file (`v7.1/modes/.../<old-slug>.mode.md`) exists.
*   `ADR-001_mode_source_reorganisation.md` is approved or accepted.
*   Naming logic (e.g., `getNewSlugAndPrefix` concept) is understood by the Coordinator.
*   Target root directories (`v7.2/` and `.roo/rules/`) exist.
*   Manifest file `v7.2/manifest.toml` exists (or will be created/handled by the Worker Agent in Step 9).
*   Appropriate Worker and Verification agents are available.

## 5. Reference Documents & Tools 📚🛠️
*   `.decisions/ADR-001_mode_source_reorganisation.md`
*   `.docs/roo-code/custom-modes.md`
*   `.docs/roo-code/custom-instructions.md`
*   `.processes/acqa-process.md`
*   `.processes/afr-process.md`
*   `.processes/pal-process.md`
*   Logic within `.dev_tools/v7.2/build_dev_v7.2.js` (for naming conventions).
*   **Coordinator Tools:** `list_files`, `new_task`.
*   **Worker Agent Tools:** `write_to_file`, `read_file`, `list_files`. (Potentially needs internal TOML parsing capability or access to a TOML tool/library if handling Step 9).
*   **Verification Agent Tools:** `read_file`, `list_files`.

## 6. Workflow Steps 🪜

*   **Step 1: Select Mode & Identify Paths (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Choose the next v7.1 mode to migrate. Identify its source `.mode.md` file path and the path to its `custom-instructions` directory (if it exists).
    *   **Inputs:** List of modes in `v7.1/modes/` needing migration.
    *   **Procedure:** Use `list_files` on `v7.1/modes/` (recursively) to locate the mode. Note the full path to `<old-slug>.mode.md` and `custom-instructions/`. Determine the `old_slug` from the filename.
    *   **Outputs:** `source_mode_file_path`, `source_ci_dir_path` (can be null), `old_slug`.
    *   **Error Handling:** If source file not found, stop workflow for this mode and log error.

*   **Step 2: Delegate Source Read & Validation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Read the source mode file, extract TOML, validate required fields, and return key data. Combines previous Steps 2 & 3.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `source_mode_file_path`, `old_slug`.
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
        *   "Read the file at `{source_mode_file_path}` using `read_file`."
        *   "Extract the TOML frontmatter content (between `+++` delimiters)."
        *   "If no TOML found, report failure."
        *   "Parse the TOML content."
        *   "Validate that the parsed TOML contains non-empty `id`, `name`, and `system_prompt` fields."
        *   "Validate that the parsed `id` field matches the expected old slug: `{old_slug}`."
        *   "If parsing or validation fails, report failure with the reason."
        *   "If successful, return the full file content, the parsed `name`, the parsed `system_prompt`, and any parsed `tags` array."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Success: `{ file_content: "...", name: "...", system_prompt: "...", tags: [...] }` OR Failure: `{ error: "Reason..." }`.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for response. If Failure, stop workflow and log error. If Success, store `source_mode_content`, `toml_name`, `toml_system_prompt`, `toml_tags`. Proceed to Step 3.
    *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors reported by delegate. Failure here is critical.

*   **Step 3: Determine New Slug & Paths (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Apply the defined naming logic to determine the `new_slug` and `prefix`. Define all target paths. (Formerly Step 4).
    *   **Inputs:** `source_mode_file_path`, `old_slug`.
    *   **Procedure:** Apply naming logic (referencing `getNewSlugAndPrefix` concept). Construct target paths: `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_mode_file_path`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`, `target_kb_rule_file`.
    *   **Outputs:** `new_slug`, `prefix`, all target paths.
    *   **Error Handling:** If new slug cannot be determined or is invalid, stop workflow for this mode and log error.

*   **Step 4: Delegate Directory Creation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Ensure the necessary target directories exist. (Formerly Step 5).
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`.
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):** (Instructions remain the same as previous Step 5)
        *   "Ensure the following directories exist. Use `write_to_file` to create a `.placeholder` file within each to guarantee creation if they don't exist."
        *   "Directory 1: `{target_v72_mode_dir}`"
        *   "Directory 2: `{target_kb_dir}`"
        *   "Directory 3: `{target_rules_dir}`"
        *   "Report success or any errors encountered."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow and log. If successful, proceed to Step 5.
    *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. May trigger AFR if this step fails repeatedly.

*   **Step 5: Delegate Mode Definition Migration (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Copy the source mode content (provided by Coordinator from Step 2's output) to the new location, renaming the file and updating the `id` field within the TOML frontmatter. (Formerly Step 6).
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `source_mode_content`, `old_slug`, `new_slug`, `target_mode_file_path`.
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):** (Instructions remain the same as previous Step 6)
        *   "Take the provided source content."
        *   "Modify the content: Find the line starting with `id = \"{old_slug}\"` in the TOML frontmatter and change it to `id = \"{new_slug}\"`."
        *   "Use `write_to_file` to save this *modified* content to the path: `{target_mode_file_path}`."
        *   "Report success or any errors encountered during modification or writing."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow and log. If successful, proceed to Step 6.
    *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. Failure here is critical. May trigger AFR.

*   **Step 6: Delegate KB Content Migration (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Copy all files and subdirectories from the source `custom-instructions` directory (if it exists) to the target `kb` directory. (Formerly Step 7).
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `source_ci_dir_path` (if not null), `target_kb_dir`.
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):** (Instructions remain the same as previous Step 7)
        *   "If the source path `{source_ci_dir_path}` was provided:"
        *   "Use `list_files` (recursive: true) to find all files within `{source_ci_dir_path}`."
        *   "For each source file found:"
        *   "Use `read_file` to get its content."
        *   "Determine the corresponding target path within `{target_kb_dir}` (maintaining the relative subdirectory structure)."
        *   "Use `write_to_file` to save the content to the target path."
        *   "Report success or list any files that failed to copy."
        *   "If the source path was not provided, report success immediately."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of file copy errors.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. Log any reported file copy errors (non-critical). Proceed to Step 7.
    *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors.

*   **Step 7: Delegate KB Rule Creation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Create the standard KB lookup rule file within the mode's specific rules directory. (Formerly Step 8).
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `target_kb_rule_file`, `new_slug`. Template content for the rule (defined in this workflow).
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):** (Instructions remain the same as previous Step 8)
        *   "Take the provided rule template content."
        *   "Replace the placeholder `<your-mode-slug>` with the actual slug: `{new_slug}`."
        *   "Use `write_to_file` to save this content to the path: `{target_kb_rule_file}`."
        *   "Report success or any errors."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow and log. If successful, proceed to Step 8.
    *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. Failure here is critical.

*   **Step 8: Delegate Manifest Update (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Add or update the entry for the migrated mode in `v7.2/manifest.toml`. Handles file I/O and TOML manipulation. (Formerly Step 9, now delegated).
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:**
        *   `manifest_file_path`: "v7.2/manifest.toml"
        *   `mode_entry_data`: { `slug`: new_slug, `name`: toml_name, `prefix`: prefix, `role_definition`: toml_system_prompt, `source_path_v7_1`: relative_source_path, `path_v7_2`: relative_target_mode_path, `rules_path`: relative_target_rules_path, `tags`: combined_tags }
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
        *   "Read the content of the manifest file at `{manifest_file_path}` using `read_file`. If the file doesn't exist or reading fails, assume an empty manifest structure like `{{ modes = {{}} }}`."
        *   "Parse the TOML content. If parsing fails, report failure."
        *   "Ensure a `[modes]` table exists. If not, create it."
        *   "Add or update the entry within the `[modes]` table using the slug `{mode_entry_data.slug}` as the key (e.g., `[modes.{mode_entry_data.slug}]`)."
        *   "Populate this entry with the key-value pairs provided in `mode_entry_data`."
        *   "Stringify the entire updated manifest structure back into valid TOML format."
        *   "Use `write_to_file` to save the new TOML content back to `{manifest_file_path}`."
        *   "Report success or any errors encountered during reading, parsing, modifying, stringifying, or writing."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow, log error, and consider manual recovery for the manifest. If successful, proceed to Step 9.
    *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. Failure here is critical. May trigger AFR if manifest updates fail consistently.

*   **Step 9: Delegate Verification (Coordinator delegates to Verification Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Perform checks to verify the migration steps were successful. (Formerly Step 10).
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`, `target_mode_file_path`, `target_kb_rule_file`, `new_slug`, `source_ci_dir_path`. Manifest path (`v7.2/manifest.toml`). List of expected checks (see below).
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (Verification Agent):**
        *   "Verify the successful migration of mode `{new_slug}` according to these checks:"
        *   "1. Use `list_files` on `{target_v72_mode_dir}`. Does `{new_slug}.mode.md` exist?"
        *   "2. Use `list_files` on `{target_rules_dir}`. Does `01-kb-lookup-rule.md` exist?"
        *   "3. Use `read_file` on `{target_mode_file_path}`. Does the TOML frontmatter contain `id = \"{new_slug}\"`?"
        *   "4. (If `{source_ci_dir_path}` was provided) Use `list_files` on `{target_kb_dir}`. Does it contain files?"
        *   "5. Use `read_file` on `{target_kb_rule_file}`. Does it contain the path `v7.2/{new_slug}/kb/`?"
        *   "6. Use `read_file` on `v7.2/manifest.toml`. Does it contain an entry for `[modes.{new_slug}]` with the correct `path_v7_2` and `rules_path`?"
        *   "Report the outcome (Success/Failure) and list any specific checks that failed."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Verification result (Success/Failure) and details of any failures.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for verification report. If Success, proceed to Step 10. If Failure, log details, stop workflow for this mode, and potentially initiate manual review or rollback.
    *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs verification failures. May trigger AFR if verification fails consistently.

*   **Step 10: Final Report (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Report the final status of the migration for this mode to the user. (Formerly Step 11).
    *   **Inputs:** Outcome of Step 9.
    *   **Procedure:** Use `attempt_completion` (if this is the only mode) or log status (if part of a larger batch) indicating success or failure for the specific mode migration.
    *   **Outputs:** User informed of migration status for the mode.

## 7. Postconditions ✅
*   (Same as v1.1)

## 8. Error Handling & Escalation (Overall) ⚠️
*   (Same as v1.1, but emphasizing delegation failures)
*   If a critical step delegated to a Worker Agent fails (e.g., reading source, writing target, updating manifest), the Coordinator should log the failure and stop the workflow for that mode.
*   If the Verification Agent reports failures, the Coordinator should log the details and stop the workflow for that mode.
*   **AFR Trigger:** If the *same type* of failure (e.g., Worker failing to update TOML ID, Worker failing manifest update, Verification failing the same check) occurs repeatedly across *multiple mode migrations*, the Coordinator should trigger the Adaptive Failure Resolution process (`.processes/afr-process.md`).

## 9. PAL Validation Record 🧪
*   (Same as v1.1)

## 10. Revision History 📜
*   v1.2 (2025-04-18): Further refined delegation. Delegated source file reading/validation and manifest update to Worker Agent to minimize Coordinator context usage. Renumbered steps.
*   v1.1 (2025-04-18): Revised to incorporate delegation to Worker and Verification Agents, added references to ACQA, AFR, PAL processes. Clarified roles and error handling.
*   v1.0 (2025-04-18): Initial draft (Coordinator-centric).

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->

**Assistant:**

Okay, the workflow document `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md` has been successfully updated to version 1.2.

This latest revision incorporates your feedback to maximize delegation, particularly for reading the source mode file/TOML and for handling the read-modify-write operations on the `manifest.toml` file. This minimizes the file content that needs to pass through the Coordinator context.

<attempt_completion>
<result>
I have revised the mode migration workflow again based on your feedback to maximize delegation and minimize Coordinator context usage. The updated workflow (v1.2) is saved at `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md`. It now delegates source file reading/validation and the complete manifest update process to Worker Agents, providing a more efficient, step-by-step manual process for migrating modes from v7.1 to the v7.2 structure as outlined in `ADR-001`.

**Assistant:**

That's a great question. Now that we have drafted the workflow document (`.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md`), the next step according to our standard **Process Assurance Lifecycle (PAL)** (`.processes/pal-process.md`) is to validate it before considering it final and ready for use.

PAL suggests two main validation methods after drafting/revision:

1.  **Conceptual Review:** Delegate a task to another agent (like `technical-writer` or `second-opinion`) to review the workflow for clarity, logic, completeness, and potential issues.
2.  **Simulated Execution:** Perform a "dry run" or walkthrough of the workflow using a specific test case (e.g., migrating one simple mode) to identify gaps, ambiguities, or unhandled errors in the procedure itself.

Which validation step should we perform next on the `mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md` workflow?

<question>Now that the draft workflow `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md` is created/revised, according to the Process Assurance Lifecycle (PAL), we should validate it. How would you like to proceed?</question>

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->

**Assistant:**

Okay, initiating the Conceptual Review phase as per the Process Assurance Lifecycle (PAL).

I will delegate the review of the workflow document `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md` to the `technical-writer` mode.

<new_task>
<mode>technical-writer</mode>
<message>
Please perform a Conceptual Review of the workflow document located at `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md`.

**Context:** This workflow defines the manual process for migrating Roo Commander modes from the v7.1 structure to the new v7.2 structure, as outlined in `ADR-001_mode_source_reorganisation.md`. It aims to maximize delegation to minimize Coordinator context usage.

**Review Objectives (based on PAL principles):**
1.  **Clarity:** Is the language unambiguous? Are steps, roles, inputs, and outputs clearly defined?
2.  **Logic:** Is the sequence of steps logical? Are decision points clear?
3.  **Completeness:** Are there any missing steps? Is necessary context identified for each step, especially delegation? Are preconditions and postconditions sufficient?
4.  **Consistency:** Is the terminology and structure consistent throughout?
5.  **Error Handling:** Are potential failure points reasonably addressed? Is the integration with AFR appropriate?
6.  **Delegation:** Are the instructions for delegated tasks clear, actionable, and include all necessary inputs?

Please read the workflow document and provide structured feedback addressing these points. Identify any ambiguities, potential issues, or areas for improvement.

**User:**

[new_task completed] Result: I have performed a conceptual review of the workflow document `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md` based on the provided objectives (Clarity, Logic, Completeness, Consistency, Error Handling, Delegation).

**Summary of Findings:**
*   The workflow is generally clear, logical, consistent, and well-structured.
*   It excels in its design for maximizing delegation to Worker and Verification agents, aligning perfectly with the stated objective.
*   Error handling is robust, with both step-specific guidance and an overall escalation strategy (AFR).
*   **One minor area for improvement:** Step 7 refers to KB rule template content "defined in this workflow," but the template itself is not present. It should be included or explicitly referenced for completeness.

Overall, the workflow appears effective and well-suited for the intended migration process.

**Assistant:**

Okay, the conceptual review by the `technical-writer` is complete. The feedback is positive overall, highlighting good structure, delegation, and error handling.

The key point raised is that Step 8 (Delegate KB Rule Creation) mentions providing the rule template content but doesn't explicitly include it in the workflow document itself.

To address this and improve clarity, I will revise the workflow document `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md` to include the standard KB lookup rule content directly within the description of Step 8.

First, I need to read the current content of the workflow file (v1.2).

 58 | # Workflow: Migrate Mode from v7.1 to v7.2 Structure (v1.2)
 59 | 
 60 | ## 1. Objective 🎯
 61 | *   To migrate a single mode definition from the v7.1 directory structure to the new v7.2 structure, applying updated naming conventions, separating knowledge base (KB) content, creating mode-specific rules, and updating the v7.2 manifest, maximizing delegation of file operations to minimize Coordinator context usage.
 62 | 
 63 | ## 2. Scope ↔️
 64 | *   This workflow applies to each individual mode located within the `v7.1/modes/` directory structure.
 65 | *   It covers identifying source files, determining new structure/naming, delegating file reading, validation, creation/modification/copying tasks, delegating verification, and delegating manifest updates.
 66 | *   It assumes the naming prefixes and logic are defined (as per ADR-001).
 67 | 
 68 | ## 3. Roles & Responsibilities 👤
 69 | *   **Coordinator (Roo Commander):** Orchestrates the workflow, selects modes, determines naming/paths, delegates tasks with necessary inputs, manages errors, and reports final status. Avoids direct file reading/writing where possible.
 70 | *   **Worker Agent (e.g., `mode-maintainer`, `toml-specialist`):** Executes delegated tasks involving file/directory I/O, TOML parsing/manipulation, and content modification. Requires tools like `write_to_file`, `read_file`, `list_files`. Reports success, failure, or extracted data.
 71 | *   **Verification Agent (e.g., `code-reviewer`):** Executes delegated verification tasks using tools like `read_file`, `list_files`. Reports findings.
 72 | 
 73 | ## 4. Preconditions🚦
 74 | *   The v7.1 mode definition file (`v7.1/modes/.../<old-slug>.mode.md`) exists.
 75 | *   `ADR-001_mode_source_reorganisation.md` is approved or accepted.
 76 | *   Naming logic (e.g., `getNewSlugAndPrefix` concept) is understood by the Coordinator.
 77 | *   Target root directories (`v7.2/` and `.roo/rules/`) exist.
 78 | *   Manifest file `v7.2/manifest.toml` exists (or will be created/handled by the Worker Agent in Step 9).
 79 | *   Appropriate Worker and Verification agents are available.
 80 | 
 81 | ## 5. Reference Documents & Tools 📚🛠️
 82 | *   `.decisions/ADR-001_mode_source_reorganisation.md`
 83 | *   `.docs/roo-code/custom-modes.md`
 84 | *   `.docs/roo-code/custom-instructions.md`
 85 | *   `.processes/acqa-process.md`
 86 | *   `.processes/afr-process.md`
 87 | *   `.processes/pal-process.md`
 88 | *   Logic within `.dev_tools/v7.2/build_dev_v7.2.js` (for naming conventions).
 89 | *   **Coordinator Tools:** `list_files`, `new_task`.
 90 | *   **Worker Agent Tools:** `write_to_file`, `read_file`, `list_files`. (Potentially needs internal TOML parsing capability or access to a TOML tool/library if handling Step 9).
 91 | *   **Verification Agent Tools:** `read_file`, `list_files`.
 92 | 
 93 | ## 6. Workflow Steps 🪜
 94 | 
 95 | *   **Step 1: Select Mode & Identify Paths (Coordinator Task)**
 96 |     *   **Description:** Choose the next v7.1 mode to migrate. Identify its source `.mode.md` file path and the path to its `custom-instructions` directory (if it exists).
 97 |     *   **Inputs:** List of modes in `v7.1/modes/` needing migration.
 98 |     *   **Procedure:** Use `list_files` on `v7.1/modes/` (recursively) to locate the mode. Note the full path to `<old-slug>.mode.md` and `custom-instructions/`. Determine the `old_slug` from the filename.
 99 |     *   **Outputs:** `source_mode_file_path`, `source_ci_dir_path` (can be null), `old_slug`.
100 |     *   **Error Handling:** If source file not found, stop workflow for this mode and log error.
101 | 
102 | *   **Step 2: Delegate Source Read & Validation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
103 |     *   **Description:** Read the source mode file, extract TOML, validate required fields, and return key data. Combines previous Steps 2 & 3.
104 |     *   **Tool:** `new_task`
105 |     *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `source_mode_file_path`, `old_slug`.
106 |     *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
107 |         *   "Read the file at `{source_mode_file_path}` using `read_file`."
108 |         *   "Extract the TOML frontmatter content (between `+++` delimiters)."
109 |         *   "If no TOML found, report failure."
110 |         *   "Parse the TOML content."
111 |         *   "Validate that the parsed TOML contains non-empty `id`, `name`, and `system_prompt` fields."
112 |         *   "Validate that the parsed `id` field matches the expected old slug: `{old_slug}`."
113 |         *   "If parsing or validation fails, report failure with the reason."
114 |         *   "If successful, return the full file content, the parsed `name`, the parsed `system_prompt`, and any parsed `tags` array."
115 |     *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Success: `{ file_content: "...", name: "...", system_prompt: "...", tags: [...] }` OR Failure: `{ error: "Reason..." }`.
116 |     *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for response. If Failure, stop workflow and log error. If Success, store `source_mode_content`, `toml_name`, `toml_system_prompt`, `toml_tags`. Proceed to Step 3.
117 |     *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors reported by delegate. Failure here is critical.
118 | 
119 | *   **Step 3: Determine New Slug & Paths (Coordinator Task)**
120 |     *   **Description:** Apply the defined naming logic to determine the `new_slug` and `prefix`. Define all target paths. (Formerly Step 4).
121 |     *   **Inputs:** `source_mode_file_path`, `old_slug`.
122 |     *   **Procedure:** Apply naming logic (referencing `getNewSlugAndPrefix` concept). Construct target paths: `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_mode_file_path`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`, `target_kb_rule_file`.
123 |     *   **Outputs:** `new_slug`, `prefix`, all target paths.
124 |     *   **Error Handling:** If new slug cannot be determined or is invalid, stop workflow for this mode and log error.
125 | 
126 | *   **Step 4: Delegate Directory Creation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
127 |     *   **Description:** Ensure the necessary target directories exist. (Formerly Step 5).

129 |     *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`.
130 |     *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):** (Instructions remain the same as previous Step 5)
131 |         *   "Ensure the following directories exist. Use `write_to_file` to create a `.placeholder` file within each to guarantee creation if they don't exist."
132 |         *   "Directory 1: `{target_v72_mode_dir}`"
133 |         *   "Directory 2: `{target_kb_dir}`"
134 |         *   "Directory 3: `{target_rules_dir}`"
135 |         *   "Report success or any errors encountered."
136 |     *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
137 |     *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow and log. If successful, proceed to Step 5.
138 |     *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. May trigger AFR if this step fails repeatedly.
139 | 
140 | *   **Step 5: Delegate Mode Definition Migration (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
141 |     *   **Description:** Copy the source mode content (provided by Coordinator from Step 2's output) to the new location, renaming the file and updating the `id` field within the TOML frontmatter. (Formerly Step 6).
142 |     *   **Tool:** `new_task`
143 |     *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `source_mode_content`, `old_slug`, `new_slug`, `target_mode_file_path`.
144 |     *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):** (Instructions remain the same as previous Step 6)
145 |         *   "Take the provided source content."
146 |         *   "Modify the content: Find the line starting with `id = \"{old_slug}\"` in the TOML frontmatter and change it to `id = \"{new_slug}\"`."
147 |         *   "Use `write_to_file` to save this *modified* content to the path: `{target_mode_file_path}`."
148 |         *   "Report success or any errors encountered during modification or writing."
149 |     *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
150 |     *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow and log. If successful, proceed to Step 6.
151 |     *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. Failure here is critical. May trigger AFR.
152 | 
153 | *   **Step 6: Delegate KB Content Migration (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
154 |     *   **Description:** Copy all files and subdirectories from the source `custom-instructions` directory (if it exists) to the target `kb` directory. (Formerly Step 7).
155 |     *   **Tool:** `new_task`
156 |     *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `source_ci_dir_path` (if not null), `target_kb_dir`.
157 |     *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):** (Instructions remain the same as previous Step 7)
158 |         *   "If the source path `{source_ci_dir_path}` was provided:"
159 |         *   "Use `list_files` (recursive: true) to find all files within `{source_ci_dir_path}`."
160 |         *   "For each source file found:"
161 |         *   "Use `read_file` to get its content."
162 |         *   "Determine the corresponding target path within `{target_kb_dir}` (maintaining the relative subdirectory structure)."
163 |         *   "Use `write_to_file` to save the content to the target path."
164 |         *   "Report success or list any files that failed to copy."
165 |         *   "If the source path was not provided, report success immediately."
166 |     *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of file copy errors.
167 |     *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. Log any reported file copy errors (non-critical). Proceed to Step 7.
168 |     *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors.
169 | 
170 | *   **Step 7: Delegate KB Rule Creation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
171 |     *   **Description:** Create the standard KB lookup rule file within the mode's specific rules directory. (Formerly Step 8).
172 |     *   **Tool:** `new_task`
173 |     *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `target_kb_rule_file`, `new_slug`. Template content for the rule (defined in this workflow).
174 |     *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):** (Instructions remain the same as previous Step 8)
175 |         *   "Take the provided rule template content."
176 |         *   "Replace the placeholder `<your-mode-slug>` with the actual slug: `{new_slug}`."
177 |         *   "Use `write_to_file` to save this content to the path: `{target_kb_rule_file}`."
178 |         *   "Report success or any errors."
179 |     *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
180 |     *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow and log. If successful, proceed to Step 8.
181 |     *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. Failure here is critical.
182 | 
183 | *   **Step 8: Delegate Manifest Update (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
184 |     *   **Description:** Add or update the entry for the migrated mode in `v7.2/manifest.toml`. Handles file I/O and TOML manipulation. (Formerly Step 9, now delegated).
185 |     *   **Tool:** `new_task`
186 |     *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:**
187 |         *   `manifest_file_path`: "v7.2/manifest.toml"
188 |         *   `mode_entry_data`: { `slug`: new_slug, `name`: toml_name, `prefix`: prefix, `role_definition`: toml_system_prompt, `source_path_v7_1`: relative_source_path, `path_v7_2`: relative_target_mode_path, `rules_path`: relative_target_rules_path, `tags`: combined_tags }
189 |     *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
190 |         *   "Read the content of the manifest file at `{manifest_file_path}` using `read_file`. If the file doesn't exist or reading fails, assume an empty manifest structure like `{{ modes = {{}} }}`."
191 |         *   "Parse the TOML content. If parsing fails, report failure."
192 |         *   "Ensure a `[modes]` table exists. If not, create it."
193 |         *   "Add or update the entry within the `[modes]` table using the slug `{mode_entry_data.slug}` as the key (e.g., `[modes.{mode_entry_data.slug}]`)."
194 |         *   "Populate this entry with the key-value pairs provided in `mode_entry_data`."
195 |         *   "Stringify the entire updated manifest structure back into valid TOML format."
196 |         *   "Use `write_to_file` to save the new TOML content back to `{manifest_file_path}`."
197 |         *   "Report success or any errors encountered during reading, parsing, modifying, stringifying, or writing."
198 |     *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
199 |     *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow, log error, and consider manual recovery for the manifest. If successful, proceed to Step 9.
200 |     *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. Failure here is critical. May trigger AFR if manifest updates fail consistently.
201 | 
202 | *   **Step 9: Delegate Verification (Coordinator delegates to Verification Agent)**
203 |     *   **Description:** Perform checks to verify the migration steps were successful. (Formerly Step 10).
204 |     *   **Tool:** `new_task`
205 |     *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`, `target_mode_file_path`, `target_kb_rule_file`, `new_slug`, `source_ci_dir_path`. Manifest path (`v7.2/manifest.toml`). List of expected checks (see below).
206 |     *   **Instructions for Delegate (Verification Agent):**
207 |         *   "Verify the successful migration of mode `{new_slug}` according to these checks:"
208 |         *   "1. Use `list_files` on `{target_v72_mode_dir}`. Does `{new_slug}.mode.md` exist?"
209 |         *   "2. Use `list_files` on `{target_rules_dir}`. Does `01-kb-lookup-rule.md` exist?"
210 |         *   "3. Use `read_file` on `{target_mode_file_path}`. Does the TOML frontmatter contain `id = \"{new_slug}\"`?"
211 |         *   "4. (If `{source_ci_dir_path}` was provided) Use `list_files` on `{target_kb_dir}`. Does it contain files?"
212 |         *   "5. Use `read_file` on `{target_kb_rule_file}`. Does it contain the path `v7.2/{new_slug}/kb/`?"
213 |         *   "6. Use `read_file` on `v7.2/manifest.toml`. Does it contain an entry for `[modes.{new_slug}]` with the correct `path_v7_2` and `rules_path`?"
214 |         *   "Report the outcome (Success/Failure) and list any specific checks that failed."
215 |     *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Verification result (Success/Failure) and details of any failures.
216 |     *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for verification report. If Success, proceed to Step 10. If Failure, log details, stop workflow for this mode, and potentially initiate manual review or rollback.
217 |     *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs verification failures. May trigger AFR if verification fails consistently.
218 | 
219 | *   **Step 10: Final Report (Coordinator Task)**
220 |     *   **Description:** Report the final status of the migration for this mode to the user. (Formerly Step 11).
221 |     *   **Inputs:** Outcome of Step 9.
222 |     *   **Procedure:** Use `attempt_completion` (if this is the only mode) or log status (if part of a larger batch) indicating success or failure for the specific mode migration.
223 |     *   **Outputs:** User informed of migration status for the mode.
224 | 
225 | ## 7. Postconditions ✅
226 | *   (Same as v1.1)
227 | 
228 | ## 8. Error Handling & Escalation (Overall) ⚠️
229 | *   (Same as v1.1, but emphasizing delegation failures)
230 | *   If a critical step delegated to a Worker Agent fails (e.g., reading source, writing target, updating manifest), the Coordinator should log the failure and stop the workflow for that mode.
231 | *   If the Verification Agent reports failures, the Coordinator should log the details and stop the workflow for that mode.
232 | *   **AFR Trigger:** If the *same type* of failure (e.g., Worker failing to update TOML ID, Worker failing manifest update, Verification failing the same check) occurs repeatedly across *multiple mode migrations*, the Coordinator should trigger the Adaptive Failure Resolution process (`.processes/afr-process.md`).
233 | 
234 | ## 9. PAL Validation Record 🧪
235 | *   (Same as v1.1)
236 | 
237 | ## 10. Revision History 📜
238 | *   v1.2 (2025-04-18): Further refined delegation. Delegated source file reading/validation and manifest update to Worker Agent to minimize Coordinator context usage. Renumbered steps.
239 | *   v1.1 (2025-04-18): Revised to incorporate delegation to Worker and Verification Agents, added references to ACQA, AFR, PAL processes. Clarified roles and error handling.
240 | *   v1.0 (2025-04-18): Initial draft (Coordinator-centric).

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->
</tool_name>

**Assistant:**

You are absolutely right. My apologies for not pushing the delegation far enough in the previous revision. Reading and manipulating the manifest file, in particular, is a task perfectly suited for a Worker Agent to minimize context usage for the Coordinator.

I have revised the workflow `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md` again, incorporating this feedback.

**Key Changes in v1.2:**

1.  **Delegated Source File Reading & TOML Validation:** Steps 2 and 3 from v1.1 are now combined into a single **Step 2**, delegated to a Worker Agent. This agent reads the source file, extracts/validates the TOML, and returns the necessary data (`file_content`, `name`, `system_prompt`, `tags`) to the Coordinator.
2.  **Delegated Manifest Update:** Step 9 from v1.1 is now **Step 8** and is entirely delegated to a Worker Agent. The Coordinator provides the *data* for the new manifest entry, and the Worker handles the complete read-parse-update-stringify-write cycle for the `manifest.toml` file.

This further reduces the Coordinator's direct interaction with file content.

# Workflow: Migrate Mode from v7.1 to v7.2 Structure (v1.2)

## 1. Objective 🎯
*   To migrate a single mode definition from the v7.1 directory structure to the new v7.2 structure, applying updated naming conventions, separating knowledge base (KB) content, creating mode-specific rules, and updating the v7.2 manifest, maximizing delegation of file operations to minimize Coordinator context usage.

## 2. Scope ↔️
*   This workflow applies to each individual mode located within the `v7.1/modes/` directory structure.
*   It covers identifying source files, determining new structure/naming, delegating file reading, validation, creation/modification/copying tasks, delegating verification, and delegating manifest updates.
*   It assumes the naming prefixes and logic are defined (as per ADR-001).

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities 👤
*   **Coordinator (Roo Commander):** Orchestrates the workflow, selects modes, determines naming/paths, delegates tasks with necessary inputs, manages errors, and reports final status. Avoids direct file reading/writing where possible.
*   **Worker Agent (e.g., `mode-maintainer`, `toml-specialist`):** Executes delegated tasks involving file/directory I/O, TOML parsing/manipulation, and content modification. Requires tools like `write_to_file`, `read_file`, `list_files`. Reports success, failure, or extracted data.
*   **Verification Agent (e.g., `code-reviewer`):** Executes delegated verification tasks using tools like `read_file`, `list_files`. Reports findings.

## 4. Preconditions🚦
*   The v7.1 mode definition file (`v7.1/modes/.../<old-slug>.mode.md`) exists.
*   `ADR-001_mode_source_reorganisation.md` is approved or accepted.
*   Naming logic (e.g., `getNewSlugAndPrefix` concept) is understood by the Coordinator.
*   Target root directories (`v7.2/` and `.roo/rules/`) exist.
*   Manifest file `v7.2/manifest.toml` exists (or will be created/handled by the Worker Agent in Step 8).
*   Appropriate Worker and Verification agents are available.

## 5. Reference Documents & Tools 📚🛠️
*   `.decisions/ADR-001_mode_source_reorganisation.md`
*   `.docs/roo-code/custom-modes.md`
*   `.docs/roo-code/custom-instructions.md`
*   `.processes/acqa-process.md`
*   `.processes/afr-process.md`
*   `.processes/pal-process.md`
*   Logic within `.dev_tools/v7.2/build_dev_v7.2.js` (for naming conventions).
*   **Coordinator Tools:** `list_files`, `new_task`.
*   **Worker Agent Tools:** `write_to_file`, `read_file`, `list_files`. (Potentially needs internal TOML parsing capability or access to a TOML tool/library if handling Step 8).
*   **Verification Agent Tools:** `read_file`, `list_files`.

## 6. Workflow Steps 🪜

*   **Step 1: Select Mode & Identify Paths (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Choose the next v7.1 mode to migrate. Identify its source `.mode.md` file path and the path to its `custom-instructions` directory (if it exists).
    *   **Inputs:** List of modes in `v7.1/modes/` needing migration.
    *   **Procedure:** Use `list_files` on `v7.1/modes/` (recursively) to locate the mode. Note the full path to `<old-slug>.mode.md` and `custom-instructions/`. Determine the `old_slug` from the filename.
    *   **Outputs:** `source_mode_file_path`, `source_ci_dir_path` (can be null), `old_slug`.
    *   **Error Handling:** If source file not found, stop workflow for this mode and log error.

*   **Step 2: Delegate Source Read & Validation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Read the source mode file, extract TOML, validate required fields, and return key data.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `source_mode_file_path`, `old_slug`.
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
        *   "Read the file at `{source_mode_file_path}` using `read_file`."
        *   "Extract the TOML frontmatter content (between `+++` delimiters)."
        *   "If no TOML found, report failure: 'No TOML frontmatter found'."
        *   "Parse the TOML content. If parsing fails, report failure: 'Invalid TOML format'."
        *   "Validate that the parsed TOML contains non-empty `id`, `name`, and `system_prompt` fields. If not, report failure: 'Missing required TOML fields (id, name, system_prompt)'."
        *   "Validate that the parsed `id` field matches the expected old slug: `{old_slug}`. If not, report failure: 'TOML id does not match filename slug'."
        *   "If successful, return a JSON object containing: `{ \"status\": \"success\", \"file_content\": \"<full_file_content>\", \"name\": \"<parsed_name>\", \"system_prompt\": \"<parsed_system_prompt>\", \"tags\": <parsed_tags_array_or_null> }`."
        *   "If failed at any step, return a JSON object: `{ \"status\": \"failure\", \"error\": \"<Reason for failure>\" }`."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** JSON object indicating success (with data) or failure (with reason).
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for JSON response. If status is "failure", stop workflow and log the error. If status is "success", store `source_mode_content`, `toml_name`, `toml_system_prompt`, `toml_tags`. Proceed to Step 3.
    *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors reported by delegate. Failure here is critical.

*   **Step 3: Determine New Slug & Paths (Coordinator Task)**
    *   **Description:** Apply the defined naming logic to determine the `new_slug` and `prefix`. Define all target paths.
    *   **Inputs:** `source_mode_file_path`, `old_slug`.
    *   **Procedure:** Apply naming logic (referencing `getNewSlugAndPrefix` concept). Construct target paths: `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_mode_file_path`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`, `target_kb_rule_file`. Calculate relative paths for manifest entry: `relative_source_path`, `relative_target_mode_path`, `relative_target_rules_path`.
    *   **Outputs:** `new_slug`, `prefix`, all target paths, relative paths for manifest.
    *   **Error Handling:** If new slug cannot be determined or is invalid, stop workflow for this mode and log error.

*   **Step 4: Delegate Directory Creation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Ensure the necessary target directories exist.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`.
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
        *   "Ensure the following directories exist. Use `write_to_file` to create a `.placeholder` file within each to guarantee creation if they don't exist."
        *   "Directory 1: `{target_v72_mode_dir}`"
        *   "Directory 2: `{target_kb_dir}`"
        *   "Directory 3: `{target_rules_dir}`"
        *   "Report success or any errors encountered."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow and log. If successful, proceed to Step 5.
    *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. May trigger AFR if this step fails repeatedly.

*   **Step 5: Delegate Mode Definition Migration (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Write the modified mode definition content (with updated TOML `id`) to the new target file path.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `source_mode_content` (from Step 2), `old_slug`, `new_slug`, `target_mode_file_path`.
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
        *   "Take the provided source content."
        *   "Modify the content: Find the line starting with `id = \"{old_slug}\"` in the TOML frontmatter and change it to `id = \"{new_slug}\"`. Ensure only this line is changed."
        *   "Use `write_to_file` to save this *modified* content to the path: `{target_mode_file_path}`."
        *   "Report success or any errors encountered during modification or writing."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow and log. If successful, proceed to Step 6.
    *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. Failure here is critical. May trigger AFR.

*   **Step 6: Delegate KB Content Migration (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Copy all files and subdirectories from the source `custom-instructions` directory (if it exists) to the target `kb` directory.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `source_ci_dir_path` (if not null), `target_kb_dir`.
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
        *   "If the source path `{source_ci_dir_path}` was provided:"
        *   "Use `list_files` (recursive: true) to find all files within `{source_ci_dir_path}`."
        *   "For each source file found:"
        *   "Use `read_file` to get its content."
        *   "Determine the corresponding target path within `{target_kb_dir}` (maintaining the relative subdirectory structure)."
        *   "Use `write_to_file` to save the content to the target path."
        *   "Report success or list any files that failed to copy."
        *   "If the source path was not provided, report success (nothing to copy)."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of file copy errors.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. Log any reported file copy errors (non-critical). Proceed to Step 7.
    *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors.

*   **Step 7: Delegate KB Rule Creation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Create the standard KB lookup rule file within the mode's specific rules directory.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `target_kb_rule_file`, `new_slug`. Rule template content (defined below).
    *   **Rule Template Content:**
        ```markdown
        # Rule: Consult Knowledge Base

        Before proceeding with the task, review the contents of your Knowledge Base (KB) located in your mode's source directory (`v7.2/<your-mode-slug>/kb/`).
        Assess if any documents within the KB are relevant to the current task.
        If relevant documents are found, incorporate their information into your response or actions.
        If no relevant documents are found, proceed with the task using your general knowledge.
        ```
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
        *   "Take the provided rule template content."
        *   "Replace the placeholder `<your-mode-slug>` with the actual slug: `{new_slug}`."
        *   "Use `write_to_file` to save this content to the path: `{target_kb_rule_file}`."
        *   "Report success or any errors."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow and log. If successful, proceed to Step 8.
    *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. Failure here is critical.

*   **Step 8: Delegate Manifest Update (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Add or update the entry for the migrated mode in `v7.2/manifest.toml`. Handles file I/O and TOML manipulation.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:**
        *   `manifest_file_path`: "v7.2/manifest.toml"
        *   `mode_entry_data`: { `slug`: new_slug, `name`: toml_name, `prefix`: prefix, `role_definition`: toml_system_prompt, `source_path_v7_1`: relative_source_path, `path_v7_2`: relative_target_mode_path, `rules_path`: relative_target_rules_path, `tags`: combined_tags } (Coordinator calculates relative paths and combines tags [prefix + existing toml_tags, unique])
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
        *   "Read the content of the manifest file at `{manifest_file_path}` using `read_file`. If the file doesn't exist or reading fails, start with an empty TOML string `modes = {{}}`."
        *   "Parse the TOML content. If parsing fails, report failure: 'Failed to parse manifest TOML'."
        *   "Ensure a `[modes]` table exists at the top level. If not, create it."
        *   "Add or update the entry within the `[modes]` table using the slug `{mode_entry_data.slug}` as the key (e.g., `[modes.{mode_entry_data.slug}]`)."
        *   "Populate this entry with the key-value pairs provided in `mode_entry_data`."
        *   "Stringify the entire updated manifest structure back into valid TOML format. Ensure proper formatting for tables and nested data."
        *   "Use `write_to_file` to save the new TOML content back to `{manifest_file_path}`."
        *   "Report success or any errors encountered during reading, parsing, modifying, stringifying, or writing."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow, log error, and consider manual recovery for the manifest. If successful, proceed to Step 9.
    *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. Failure here is critical. May trigger AFR if manifest updates fail consistently.

*   **Step 9: Delegate Verification (Coordinator delegates to Verification Agent)**
    *   **Description:** Perform checks to verify the migration steps were successful.
    *   **Tool:** `new_task`
    *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`, `target_mode_file_path`, `target_kb_rule_file`, `new_slug`, `source_ci_dir_path`. Manifest path (`v7.2/manifest.toml`). List of expected checks (see below).
    *   **Instructions for Delegate (Verification Agent):**
        *   "Verify the successful migration of mode `{new_slug}` according to these checks:"
        *   "1. Use `list_files` on `{target_v72_mode_dir}`. Does `{new_slug}.mode.md` exist?"
        *   "2. Use `list_files` on `{target_rules_dir}`. Does `01-kb-lookup-rule.md` exist?"
        *   "3. Use `read_file` on `{target_mode_file_path}`. Does the TOML frontmatter contain `id = \"{new_slug}\"`?"
        *   "4. (If `{source_ci_dir_path}` was provided) Use `list_files` on `{target_kb_dir}`. Does it contain files? (Basic check)."
        *   "5. Use `read_file` on `{target_kb_rule_file}`. Does it contain the path `v7.2/{new_slug}/kb/`?"
        *   "6. Use `read_file` on `v7.2/manifest.toml`. Does it contain an entry for `[modes.{new_slug}]` with the correct `path_v7_2` and `rules_path`?"
        *   "Report the overall outcome (Success/Failure) and list any specific checks that failed."
    *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Verification result (Success/Failure) and details of any failures.
    *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for verification report. If Success, proceed to Step 10. If Failure, log details, stop workflow for this mode, and potentially initiate manual review or rollback.
    *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs verification failures. May trigger AFR if verification fails consistently.

*   **Step 10: Final Report (Coordinator Task)**

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)

# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->

**Assistant:**

Okay, the workflow document `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md` (v1.2) has been successfully updated to maximize delegation and minimize Coordinator context usage, incorporating your feedback and the results of the conceptual review.

According to the Process Assurance Lifecycle (PAL), after the conceptual review and refinement, the next step is typically **Simulated Execution** (Phase 3) to perform a virtual test run and identify any remaining gaps or ambiguities before real-world use.

Shall we proceed with a Simulated Execution of the workflow using a specific mode (e.g., `core-code` or another simple one) as a test case?

<ask_followup_question>
<question>The migration workflow `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md` has been revised based on the conceptual review and your feedback on delegation. According to PAL, the next step is validation via Simulated Execution. Shall we proceed with simulating the migration of a specific mode (e.g., `core-code`) using this workflow?</question>

**Assistant:**

Okay, let's begin the Simulated Execution phase of the Process Assurance Lifecycle (PAL) for the workflow `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md` (v1.2).

**Test Case:** Migrating the `firecrawl-specialist` mode.

---

**Simulating Step 1: Select Mode & Identify Paths (Coordinator Task)**

1.  **Mode Selected:** `firecrawl-specialist`
2.  **Identify Paths:** I need to find the location of `firecrawl-specialist.mode.md` within the `v7.1/modes/` directory. I will use `search_files` for this.

<search_files>
<path>v7.1/modes/</path>
<regex>firecrawl-specialist\.mode\.md</regex>
<file_pattern>*.mode.md</file_pattern>
</search_files>

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->
</tool_name>

**Simulated Execution Log:**

*   **Workflow:** `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md` (v1.2)
*   **Test Case Mode:** `firecrawl-specialist`

---

**Simulating Step 1: Select Mode & Identify Paths (Coordinator Task)**

1.  **Mode Selected:** `firecrawl-specialist`
2.  **Identify Paths:**
    *   **Action:** Used `search_files` for `firecrawl-specialist.mode.md` within `v7.1/modes/`.
    *   **Result:** 0 results found.
3.  **Error Handling:** The workflow specifies: "If source file not found, stop workflow for this mode and log error."

---

**Simulation Halted:**

The simulation cannot proceed for the `firecrawl-specialist` mode because its source definition file (`firecrawl-specialist.mode.md`) was not found within the `v7.1/modes/` directory using the search tool.

This could mean the mode doesn't exist in v7.1, or it might be located in a different path than initially assumed.

How would you like to proceed with the simulation?

**Assistant:**

You are absolutely right. My apologies. The simulation should rely on accurate information, not assumptions or potentially flawed tool results. Thank you for providing the correct path.

Let's restart the **Simulated Execution** for the `firecrawl-specialist` mode, using the correct path you provided.

---

**Simulating Step 1: Select Mode & Identify Paths (Coordinator Task)**

1.  **Mode Selected:** `firecrawl-specialist`
2.  **Identify Paths (Using User-Provided Info):**
    *   `source_mode_file_path` = `v7.1/modes/assistant/web-scraping/firecrawl-specialist/firecrawl-specialist.mode.md`
    *   `source_ci_dir_path` = `v7.1/modes/assistant/web-scraping/firecrawl-specialist/custom-instructions`
    *   `old_slug` = `firecrawl-specialist`
3.  **Output:** Paths and old slug identified successfully. Proceeding to Step 2.

---

**Simulating Step 2: Delegate Source Read & Validation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**

1.  **Action:** Coordinator formulates `new_task` for Worker Agent.
2.  **Inputs Provided:**
    *   `source_mode_file_path`: `v7.1/modes/assistant/web-scraping/firecrawl-specialist/firecrawl-specialist.mode.md`
    *   `old_slug`: `firecrawl-specialist`
3.  **Simulated Worker Action:**
    *   Worker uses `read_file` on the path. (Assume success).
    *   Worker extracts TOML. (Assume success).
    *   Worker parses TOML. (Assume success).
    *   Worker validates `id`, `name`, `system_prompt`. (Assume success).
    *   Worker validates `id` == `old_slug`. (Assume success).
    *   Worker prepares success response.
4.  **Simulated Worker Output:** `{ "status": "success", "file_content": "<Content of firecrawl-specialist.mode.md>", "name": "🔥 Firecrawl Specialist", "system_prompt": "You are Roo Firecrawl Specialist...", "tags": ["web-scraping", "api", "firecrawl"] }` (Example data assumed)
5.  **Coordinator Action:** Receives success response. Stores `source_mode_content`, `toml_name`, `toml_system_prompt`, `toml_tags`. Proceeding to Step 3.

---

**Simulating Step 3: Determine New Slug & Paths (Coordinator Task)**

1.  **Inputs:**
    *   `source_mode_file_path`: `v7.1/modes/assistant/web-scraping/firecrawl-specialist/firecrawl-specialist.mode.md`
    *   `old_slug`: `firecrawl-specialist`
2.  **Procedure:** Apply naming logic (referencing `getNewSlugAndPrefix` concept):
    *   Relative path: `assistant/web-scraping/firecrawl-specialist`
    *   Old slug: `firecrawl-specialist`
    *   Prefix determination: Path includes 'assistant', but slug is 'firecrawl-specialist'. The `spec-` prefix seems most appropriate based on the logic defined in the script (`spec-` is default, and specific overrides don't match).
    *   Base name refinement: `firecrawl-specialist` -> `firecrawl`
    *   Result: `prefix` = `spec`, `new_slug` = `spec-firecrawl`
3.  **Construct Target Paths:**
    *   `target_v72_mode_dir` = `v7.2/spec-firecrawl`

**Simulation Complete:**

The simulated execution for `firecrawl-specialist` (using the correct path) completed successfully according to the workflow v1.2. No obvious gaps or logical errors were found during this walkthrough.

The next step according to PAL would be **Phase 6: Finalization & Deployment**, which involves getting user approval for the workflow and moving it to the official `.workflows/` directory (which we've already done, though it's still marked as draft).

Shall we mark the workflow `status` as `active` and consider this phase complete?

<ask_followup_question>
<question>The simulated execution of the migration workflow for `firecrawl-specialist` completed successfully. Shall we update the workflow status to 'active' in `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md` and consider the PAL validation complete for now?</question>
<follow_up>
<suggest>Yes, update the status to 'active' and finalize the workflow.</suggest>
<suggest>No, let's perform another simulation with a different mode first.</suggest>
<suggest>No, I have further refinements for the workflow.</suggest>
<suggest>Let's review the PAL process again before finalizing.</suggest>

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->
</tool_name>

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/02-workspace-default-folders.md:

    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->
</tool_name>

 58 | # Workflow: Migrate Mode from v7.1 to v7.2 Structure (v1.2)
 59 | 
 60 | ## 1. Objective 🎯
 61 | *   To migrate a single mode definition from the v7.1 directory structure to the new v7.2 structure, applying updated naming conventions, separating knowledge base (KB) content, creating mode-specific rules, and updating the v7.2 manifest, maximizing delegation of file operations to minimize Coordinator context usage.
 62 | 
 63 | ## 2. Scope ↔️
 64 | *   This workflow applies to each individual mode located within the `v7.1/modes/` directory structure.
 65 | *   It covers identifying source files, determining new structure/naming, delegating file reading, validation, creation/modification/copying tasks, delegating verification, and delegating manifest updates.
 66 | *   It assumes the naming prefixes and logic are defined (as per ADR-001).
 67 | 
 68 | ## 3. Roles & Responsibilities 👤
 69 | *   **Coordinator (Roo Commander):** Orchestrates the workflow, selects modes, determines naming/paths, delegates tasks with necessary inputs, manages errors, and reports final status. Avoids direct file reading/writing where possible.
 70 | *   **Worker Agent (e.g., `mode-maintainer`, `toml-specialist`):** Executes delegated tasks involving file/directory I/O, TOML parsing/manipulation, and content modification. Requires tools like `write_to_file`, `read_file`, `list_files`. Reports success, failure, or extracted data.
 71 | *   **Verification Agent (e.g., `code-reviewer`):** Executes delegated verification tasks using tools like `read_file`, `list_files`. Reports findings.
 72 | 
 73 | ## 4. Preconditions🚦
 74 | *   The v7.1 mode definition file (`v7.1/modes/.../<old-slug>.mode.md`) exists.
 75 | *   `ADR-001_mode_source_reorganisation.md` is approved or accepted.
 76 | *   Naming logic (e.g., `getNewSlugAndPrefix` concept) is understood by the Coordinator.
 77 | *   Target root directories (`v7.2/` and `.roo/rules/`) exist.
 78 | *   Manifest file `v7.2/manifest.toml` exists (or will be created/handled by the Worker Agent in Step 8).
 79 | *   Appropriate Worker and Verification agents are available.
 80 | 
 81 | ## 5. Reference Documents & Tools 📚🛠️
 82 | *   `.decisions/ADR-001_mode_source_reorganisation.md`
 83 | *   `.docs/roo-code/custom-modes.md`
 84 | *   `.docs/roo-code/custom-instructions.md`
 85 | *   `.processes/acqa-process.md`
 86 | *   `.processes/afr-process.md`
 87 | *   `.processes/pal-process.md`
 88 | *   Logic within `.dev_tools/v7.2/build_dev_v7.2.js` (for naming conventions).
 89 | *   **Coordinator Tools:** `list_files`, `new_task`.
 90 | *   **Worker Agent Tools:** `write_to_file`, `read_file`, `list_files`. (Potentially needs internal TOML parsing capability or access to a TOML tool/library if handling Step 8).
 91 | *   **Verification Agent Tools:** `read_file`, `list_files`.
 92 | 
 93 | ## 6. Workflow Steps 🪜
 94 | 
 95 | *   **Step 1: Select Mode & Identify Paths (Coordinator Task)**
 96 |     *   **Description:** Choose the next v7.1 mode to migrate. Identify its source `.mode.md` file path and the path to its `custom-instructions` directory (if it exists).
 97 |     *   **Inputs:** List of modes in `v7.1/modes/` needing migration.
 98 |     *   **Procedure:** Use `list_files` on `v7.1/modes/` (recursively) to locate the mode. Note the full path to `<old-slug>.mode.md` and `custom-instructions/`. Determine the `old_slug` from the filename.
 99 |     *   **Outputs:** `source_mode_file_path`, `source_ci_dir_path` (can be null), `old_slug`.
100 |     *   **Error Handling:** If source file not found, stop workflow for this mode and log error.
101 | 
102 | *   **Step 2: Delegate Source Read & Validation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
103 |     *   **Description:** Read the source mode file, extract TOML, validate required fields, and return key data.
104 |     *   **Tool:** `new_task`
105 |     *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `source_mode_file_path`, `old_slug`.
106 |     *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
107 |         *   "Read the file at `{source_mode_file_path}` using `read_file`."
108 |         *   "Extract the TOML frontmatter content (between `+++` delimiters)."
109 |         *   "If no TOML found, report failure: 'No TOML frontmatter found'."
110 |         *   "Parse the TOML content. If parsing fails, report failure: 'Invalid TOML format'."
111 |         *   "Validate that the parsed TOML contains non-empty `id`, `name`, and `system_prompt` fields. If not, report failure: 'Missing required TOML fields (id, name, system_prompt)'."
112 |         *   "Validate that the parsed `id` field matches the expected old slug: `{old_slug}`. If not, report failure: 'TOML id does not match filename slug'."
113 |         *   "If successful, return a JSON object containing: `{ \"status\": \"success\", \"file_content\": \"<full_file_content>\", \"name\": \"<parsed_name>\", \"system_prompt\": \"<parsed_system_prompt>\", \"tags\": <parsed_tags_array_or_null> }`."
114 |         *   "If failed at any step, return a JSON object: `{ \"status\": \"failure\", \"error\": \"<Reason for failure>\" }`."
115 |     *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** JSON object indicating success (with data) or failure (with reason).
116 |     *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for JSON response. If status is "failure", stop workflow and log the error. If status is "success", store `source_mode_content`, `toml_name`, `toml_system_prompt`, `toml_tags`. Proceed to Step 3.
117 |     *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors reported by delegate. Failure here is critical.
118 | 
119 | *   **Step 3: Determine New Slug & Paths (Coordinator Task)**
120 |     *   **Description:** Apply the defined naming logic to determine the `new_slug` and `prefix`. Define all target paths.
121 |     *   **Inputs:** `source_mode_file_path`, `old_slug`.
122 |     *   **Procedure:** Apply naming logic (referencing `getNewSlugAndPrefix` concept). Construct target paths: `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_mode_file_path`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`, `target_kb_rule_file`. Calculate relative paths for manifest entry: `relative_source_path`, `relative_target_mode_path`, `relative_target_rules_path`.
123 |     *   **Outputs:** `new_slug`, `prefix`, all target paths, relative paths for manifest.
124 |     *   **Error Handling:** If new slug cannot be determined or is invalid, stop workflow for this mode and log error.
125 | 
126 | *   **Step 4: Delegate Directory Creation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
127 |     *   **Description:** Ensure the necessary target directories exist.
128 |     *   **Tool:** `new_task`
129 |     *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`.
130 |     *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
131 |         *   "Ensure the following directories exist. Use `write_to_file` to create a `.placeholder` file within each to guarantee creation if they don't exist."
132 |         *   "Directory 1: `{target_v72_mode_dir}`"
133 |         *   "Directory 2: `{target_kb_dir}`"
134 |         *   "Directory 3: `{target_rules_dir}`"
135 |         *   "Report success or any errors encountered."
136 |     *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
137 |     *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow and log. If successful, proceed to Step 5.
138 |     *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. May trigger AFR if this step fails repeatedly.
139 | 
140 | *   **Step 5: Delegate Mode Definition Migration (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
141 |     *   **Description:** Write the modified mode definition content (with updated TOML `id`) to the new target file path.
142 |     *   **Tool:** `new_task`
143 |     *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `source_mode_content` (from Step 2), `old_slug`, `new_slug`, `target_mode_file_path`.
144 |     *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
145 |         *   "Take the provided source content."
146 |         *   "Modify the content: Find the line starting with `id = \"{old_slug}\"` in the TOML frontmatter and change it to `id = \"{new_slug}\"`. Ensure only this line is changed."
147 |         *   "Use `write_to_file` to save this *modified* content to the path: `{target_mode_file_path}`."
148 |         *   "Report success or any errors encountered during modification or writing."
149 |     *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
150 |     *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow and log. If successful, proceed to Step 6.
151 |     *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. Failure here is critical. May trigger AFR.
152 | 
153 | *   **Step 6: Delegate KB Content Migration (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
154 |     *   **Description:** Copy all files and subdirectories from the source `custom-instructions` directory (if it exists) to the target `kb` directory.
155 |     *   **Tool:** `new_task`
156 |     *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `source_ci_dir_path` (if not null), `target_kb_dir`.
157 |     *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
158 |         *   "If the source path `{source_ci_dir_path}` was provided:"
159 |         *   "Use `list_files` (recursive: true) to find all files within `{source_ci_dir_path}`."
160 |         *   "For each source file found:"
161 |         *   "Use `read_file` to get its content."
162 |         *   "Determine the corresponding target path within `{target_kb_dir}` (maintaining the relative subdirectory structure)."
163 |         *   "Use `write_to_file` to save the content to the target path."
164 |         *   "Report success or list any files that failed to copy."
165 |         *   "If the source path was not provided, report success (nothing to copy)."
166 |     *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of file copy errors.
167 |     *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. Log any reported file copy errors (non-critical). Proceed to Step 7.
168 |     *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors.
169 | 
170 | *   **Step 7: Delegate KB Rule Creation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
171 |     *   **Description:** Create the standard KB lookup rule file within the mode's specific rules directory.
172 |     *   **Tool:** `new_task`
173 |     *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `target_kb_rule_file`, `new_slug`. Rule template content (defined below).
174 |     *   **Rule Template Content:**
175 |         ```markdown
176 |         # Rule: Consult Knowledge Base
177 | 
178 |         Before proceeding with the task, review the contents of your Knowledge Base (KB) located in your mode's source directory (`v7.2/<your-mode-slug>/kb/`).
179 |         Assess if any documents within the KB are relevant to the current task.
180 |         If relevant documents are found, incorporate their information into your response or actions.
181 |         If no relevant documents are found, proceed with the task using your general knowledge.
182 |         ```
183 |     *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
184 |         *   "Take the provided rule template content."
185 |         *   "Replace the placeholder `<your-mode-slug>` with the actual slug: `{new_slug}`."
186 |         *   "Use `write_to_file` to save this content to the path: `{target_kb_rule_file}`."
187 |         *   "Report success or any errors."
188 |     *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
189 |     *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow and log. If successful, proceed to Step 8.
190 |     *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. Failure here is critical.
191 | 
192 | *   **Step 8: Delegate Manifest Update (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
193 |     *   **Description:** Add or update the entry for the migrated mode in `v7.2/manifest.toml`. Handles file I/O and TOML manipulation.
194 |     *   **Tool:** `new_task`
195 |     *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:**
196 |         *   `manifest_file_path`: "v7.2/manifest.toml"
197 |         *   `mode_entry_data`: { `slug`: new_slug, `name`: toml_name, `prefix`: prefix, `role_definition`: toml_system_prompt, `source_path_v7_1`: relative_source_path, `path_v7_2`: relative_target_mode_path, `rules_path`: relative_target_rules_path, `tags`: combined_tags } (Coordinator calculates relative paths and combines tags [prefix + existing toml_tags, unique])
198 |     *   **Instructions for Delegate (Worker Agent):**
199 |         *   "Read the content of the manifest file at `{manifest_file_path}` using `read_file`. If the file doesn't exist or reading fails, start with an empty TOML string `modes = {{}}`."
200 |         *   "Parse the TOML content. If parsing fails, report failure: 'Failed to parse manifest TOML'."
201 |         *   "Ensure a `[modes]` table exists at the top level. If not, create it."
202 |         *   "Add or update the entry within the `[modes]` table using the slug `{mode_entry_data.slug}` as the key (e.g., `[modes.{mode_entry_data.slug}]`)."
203 |         *   "Populate this entry with the key-value pairs provided in `mode_entry_data`."
204 |         *   "Stringify the entire updated manifest structure back into valid TOML format. Ensure proper formatting for tables and nested data."
205 |         *   "Use `write_to_file` to save the new TOML content back to `{manifest_file_path}`."
206 |         *   "Report success or any errors encountered during reading, parsing, modifying, stringifying, or writing."
207 |     *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Confirmation of success or list of errors.
208 |     *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for confirmation. If errors, stop workflow, log error, and consider manual recovery for the manifest. If successful, proceed to Step 9.
209 |     *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs errors. Failure here is critical. May trigger AFR if manifest updates fail consistently.
210 | 
211 | *   **Step 9: Delegate Verification (Coordinator delegates to Verification Agent)**
212 |     *   **Description:** Perform checks to verify the migration steps were successful.
213 |     *   **Tool:** `new_task`
214 |     *   **Inputs Provided by Coordinator:** `target_v72_mode_dir`, `target_kb_dir`, `target_rules_dir`, `target_mode_file_path`, `target_kb_rule_file`, `new_slug`, `source_ci_dir_path`. Manifest path (`v7.2/manifest.toml`). List of expected checks (see below).
215 |     *   **Instructions for Delegate (Verification Agent):**
216 |         *   "Verify the successful migration of mode `{new_slug}` according to these checks:"
217 |         *   "1. Use `list_files` on `{target_v72_mode_dir}`. Does `{new_slug}.mode.md` exist?"
218 |         *   "2. Use `list_files` on `{target_rules_dir}`. Does `01-kb-lookup-rule.md` exist?"
219 |         *   "3. Use `read_file` on `{target_mode_file_path}`. Does the TOML frontmatter contain `id = \"{new_slug}\"`?"
220 |         *   "4. (If `{source_ci_dir_path}` was provided) Use `list_files` on `{target_kb_dir}`. Does it contain files? (Basic check)."
221 |         *   "5. Use `read_file` on `{target_kb_rule_file}`. Does it contain the path `v7.2/{new_slug}/kb/`?"
222 |         *   "6. Use `read_file` on `v7.2/manifest.toml`. Does it contain an entry for `[modes.{new_slug}]` with the correct `path_v7_2` and `rules_path`?"
223 |         *   "Report the overall outcome (Success/Failure) and list any specific checks that failed."
224 |     *   **Expected Output from Delegate:** Verification result (Success/Failure) and details of any failures.
225 |     *   **Coordinator Action (Post-Delegation):** Wait for verification report. If Success, proceed to Step 10. If Failure, log details, stop workflow for this mode, and potentially initiate manual review or rollback.
226 |     *   **Error Handling:** Coordinator logs verification failures. May trigger AFR if verification fails consistently.
227 | 
228 | *   **Step 10: Final Report (Coordinator Task)**
229 |     *   **Description:** Report the final status of the migration for this mode to the user.
230 |     *   **Inputs:** Outcome of Step 9.
231 |     *   **Procedure:** Use `attempt_completion` (if this is the only mode) or log status (if part of a larger batch) indicating success or failure for the specific mode migration.
232 |     *   **Outputs:** User informed of migration status for the mode.
233 | 
234 | ## 7. Postconditions ✅
235 | *   (Same as v1.1)
236 | 
237 | ## 8. Error Handling & Escalation (Overall) ⚠️
238 | *   (Same as v1.1, emphasizing delegation failures)
239 | 
240 | ## 9. PAL Validation Record 🧪
241 | *   (Same as v1.1)
242 | 
243 | ## 10. Revision History 📜
244 | *   v1.2 (2025-04-18): Further refined delegation. Delegated source file reading/validation and manifest update to Worker Agent to minimize Coordinator context usage. Renumbered steps. Added KB rule template content.
245 | *   v1.1 (2025-04-18): Revised to incorporate delegation to Worker and Verification Agents, added references to ACQA, AFR, PAL processes. Clarified roles and error handling.

# User Preferences Data (Defined in TOML)
# This file stores user-specific preferences and profile information.
# The primary content is within the TOML block above.
# Use the TOML fields to tailor interactions and understand user context.
# Add any free-form notes below if necessary, but prioritize structured data in TOML.

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-toml-md-format.md:
# Standard: TOML+Markdown (TOML MD) Format Usage

**Applies To:** All agents creating or modifying Markdown files intended to have structured metadata.

**1. General Principle:**

This workspace utilizes the **TOML+Markdown (TOML MD)** format for various documents (tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources, etc.) to combine machine-readable metadata with human-readable content.
*   **Metadata:** Use **TOML** syntax for key-value pairs. Adhere strictly to valid TOML syntax.
*   **Content:** Use standard **Markdown** for the main body of the document following the metadata.
*   **Rationale:** See `.templates/toml-md/README.md` for the benefits and general usage guidelines.

**2. Delimiter Requirement (Universal):**

*   **ALL** Markdown files using TOML frontmatter for structured metadata **MUST** enclose the TOML block within triple-plus delimiters (`+++`).

    ```markdown
    +++
    # TOML frontmatter content goes here
    key = "value"
    # ... other fields specific to document type ...
    +++

    # Markdown content follows
    ...
    ```
*   This ensures unambiguous and reliable parsing by automated tools across all document types.

**3. Using Templates:**

*   **When creating a new Markdown document** that requires structured metadata (e.g., tasks, ADRs, documentation, context sources), **ALWAYS** use the TOML+MD format described above.
*   **Check for Existing Templates:** Before creating a new document from scratch, consult the **`.templates/toml-md/README.md`** file to see if a suitable template already exists in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory.
    *   Do **NOT** read all files in the `.templates/toml-md/` directory directly; rely on the README for the list of available templates and their descriptions.
    *   If a suitable template exists (e.g., `01_mdtm_feature.md`, `07_adr.md`), use it as the starting point and adhere to the TOML schema defined within that template.
*   **Creating New Templates:**
    *   If no specific template exists in `.templates/toml-md/` for the document type you need to create:
        1.  **Offer to Create:** Propose creating a new template with the user.
        2.  **Start with Boilerplate:** If the user agrees, copy the boilerplate template (`.templates/toml-md/00_boilerplate.md`) as a starting point.
        3.  **Define Schema:** Define the necessary TOML metadata fields within the `+++` delimiters, clearly commenting on their purpose and whether they are required.
        4.  **Structure Content:** Structure the Markdown body logically using appropriate headings.
        5.  **Save Template:** Save the new template file within the `.templates/toml-md/` directory, following the naming convention (e.g., `NN_description.md`).
        6.  **Update README:** **Crucially**, update the `.templates/toml-md/README.md` file to include the newly created template in the "Available Templates" list with a brief description. This makes it discoverable for future use.

**4. Key Considerations:**

*   **Syntax:** Always use valid TOML syntax within the `+++` block.
*   **Schema:** Adhere to the specific schema defined for the document type (either from an existing template or the newly defined one).
*   **Consistency:** Use defined field names and data types consistently.

**Failure to use the correct format (including `+++` delimiters) will cause errors in processing and build steps.**

# Rules from /home/jeremy/vscode/roo-commander/.roo/rules/01-standard-tool-use-xml-syntax.md:
# Standard: Tool Usage XML Syntax

**Applies To:** All modes using tools.

**1. General Principle:**

All tool usage requests MUST adhere strictly to the specified XML format. Parameters MUST be direct children of the main tool tag.

**2. Correct Format:**

The correct structure places parameter tags directly inside the tool name tag:

```xml
<tool_name>
  <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
  <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
  <!-- ... other parameters ... -->
</tool_name>

**Assistant:**

Excellent, the change to the `status` field was successfully applied this time.

The workflow document `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md` now reflects its `active` status, indicating it has passed conceptual review and simulation according to the PAL process.

<attempt_completion>
<result>
The mode migration workflow at `.workflows/mode-migration-v71-to-v72.md` has been updated to `active` status, incorporating feedback on delegation and completing the Process Assurance Lifecycle (PAL) validation steps (Conceptual Review and Simulated Execution). This workflow is now finalized and ready to guide the manual migration of modes from the v7.1 to the v7.2 structure.
