# Interactive New Mode Creation Workflow (v2.8 - .modes/ Structure)

## 1. Objective üéØ
To guide the creation of a new Roo Commander mode from scratch, using the `.ruru/modes/` structure, applying predefined naming conventions, separating knowledge base (KB) content (with an interactive option to generate basic KB if missing/insufficient), creating mode-specific rules, generating an **enhanced KB README**, updating the central manifest, and **enforcing the standard mode template structure**, maximizing delegation.

## 2. Scope ‚ÜîÔ∏è
Applies when creating a new mode not based on a direct migration. Assumes user interaction is available. Creates structure in `.ruru/modes/` and `.roo/rules-<slug>/`. Uses the naming convention document for guidance, prompts for KB population if needed, generates an enhanced KB README, and **populates the standard mode template**.

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities üë§
*   (No change from v2.7)

## 4. Preconditionsüö¶
*   (No change from v2.7)

## 5. Reference Documents & Tools üìöüõ†Ô∏è
*   (No change from v2.7)

## 6. Workflow Steps ü™ú

*   **Step 1: Initiation & Requirements Gathering (Coordinator, User)**
    *   Coordinator confirms the mode's purpose and target audience with the User.
    *   Coordinator consults `.ruru/modes/roo-commander/kb/available-modes-summary.md` (for classification examples) to determine the appropriate `prefix-topic` slug and `classification`.
    *   Coordinator confirms the proposed slug and classification with the User.

*   **Step 2: Context Gathering (Coordinator delegates to Context Gatherer)**
    *   (No change from v2.7)

*   **Step 3: Context Synthesis (Coordinator delegates to Context Synthesizer)**
    *   (No change from v2.7)

*   **Step 3b: Optional KB Population Prompt (Coordinator, User)**
    *   (No change from v2.7 - includes refined "Generate basic KB" option)

*   **Step 4: Delegate Directory Creation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   (No change from v2.7)

*   **Step 5: Delegate Initial Mode File Creation using Template (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   (No change from v2.7 - already uses standard template path)

*   **Step 6: Delegate Instruction File Creation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   (No change from v2.7 - handles synthesized, generated basic, or skipped KB)

*   **Step 7: Delegate Enhanced KB README Update (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   (No change from v2.7)

*   **Step 8: Delegate KB Rule Creation (Coordinator delegates to Worker Agent)**
    *   (No change from v2.7 - uses enhanced rule template)

*   **Step 9: Quality Assurance (Coordinator applies ACQA)**
    *   (No change from v2.7 - already checks template structure)

*   **Step 10: User Review & Refinement (Coordinator, User)**
    *   (No change from v2.7)

*   **Step 11: Build Mode Registry (Coordinator)**
    *   Coordinator uses `execute_command` to run `node build_roomodes.js`.
    *   Coordinator verifies the command executed successfully (exit code 0).

*   **Step 12: Reload Window (User Action - IMPORTANT)**
    *   Coordinator informs the user: "The mode structure is complete and the registry has been rebuilt. **Please reload the VS Code window now** for the changes to take effect. You can do this via the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and searching for 'Developer: Reload Window'."
    *   Coordinator waits for user confirmation that the window has been reloaded before proceeding.

*   **Step 13: Finalization (Coordinator)**
    *   Coordinator confirms with the user that the new mode is now available and functioning as expected (e.g., by attempting to switch to it or use its initial prompt if applicable).
    *   Coordinator closes the workflow task.

## 7. Postconditions ‚úÖ
*   (No change from v2.7)

## 8. Error Handling & Escalation (Overall) ‚ö†Ô∏è

## 10. Revision History üìú

*   v3.0 (2025-04-24): Added Step 11 to run `build_roomodes.js` and Step 12 to remind user to reload VS Code window. Renumbered Finalization to Step 13.
*   v2.9 (2025-04-24): Removed manifest steps/references. Added explicit reference to `available-modes-summary.md` for classification guidance in `related_docs` and Step 1. Corrected path for naming convention doc.
*   v2.8 (2025-04-18): Updated `related_templates` to reflect standard template v1.1 (containing refined KB guidance). No change to workflow steps themselves.
*   v2.7 (2025-04-18): Updated Step 5 to enforce population of the standard template. Updated verification check 3.
*   v2.6 (2025-04-18): Refined the "Generate basic KB" instruction in Step 6.
*   v2.5 (2025-04-18): Modified Step 3b prompt to offer "Generate basic KB content". Updated Step 6, 7, and 10.
*   v2.4 (2025-04-18): Enhanced Step 7 (README generation) and Step 8 (KB lookup rule). Adjusted verification check 5.
*   v2.3 (2025-04-18): Added Step 3b to handle insufficient initial context. Adjusted Step 6, 7, and 10.
*   v2.2 (2025-04-18): Updated Step 1/3 to use naming convention doc. Status back to draft.
*   v2.1 (2025-04-18): Incorporated conceptual review feedback. Added `domain`. Clarified manifest creation. Added `new_task`. Embedded KB rule content. Updated error handling. Added template compatibility note.
