# Project Patterns and Intelligence

1. Running Neovim v0.11.0-dev with potential runtime path issues
2. Configuration based on Kickstart.nvim template
3. Core issue: vim.diagnostic module and syntax.vim not found
4. Using lazy.nvim for plugin management with lazy loading
5. LSP setup depends on proper runtime file configuration
6. Memory bank tracks project state in cline_docs/
7. Configuration lives in ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
8. Runtime files expected in standard system locations
9. Regular :checkhealth checks recommended
10. Critical to verify VIMRUNTIME environment variable
