# Active Context: Neovim Configuration

## Current Focus
Resolving runtime file location issues and ensuring proper module loading, specifically:
1. vim.diagnostic module not found
2. Missing syntax.vim file
3. Proper runtime path configuration

## Recent Changes
None documented yet - initial setup of memory bank

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Verify VIMRUNTIME environment variable
   - Check Neovim runtime files installation
   - Run :checkhealth to diagnose issues
   - Consider reinstalling Neovim if needed

2. **Investigation Required**:
   - Determine why vim.diagnostic module isn't found despite running Neovim v0.11.0-dev
   - Verify proper installation of runtime files
   - Check for any conflicts in configuration

## Active Decisions
1. Using Neovim v0.11.0-dev (development version)
2. Following Kickstart.nvim template for configuration
3. Implementing diagnostic functionality through vim.diagnostic

## Current Considerations
1. Whether to switch to a stable Neovim release
2. How to properly configure runtime paths
3. Best approach for runtime file management
4. Impact on plugin functionality
