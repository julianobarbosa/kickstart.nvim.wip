# Product Context: Neovim Configuration

## Why This Project Exists
This Neovim configuration exists to provide a robust, maintainable development environment based on the Kickstart.nvim template. It aims to deliver modern editor features while maintaining simplicity and transparency in its implementation.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Module Accessibility**: Currently addressing issues with runtime file locations and module loading, specifically the vim.diagnostic module
2. **Development Environment**: Provides a comprehensive IDE-like environment through:
   - LSP integration for code intelligence
   - Treesitter for advanced syntax highlighting
   - Fuzzy finding and file navigation
   - Git integration
   - Diagnostic capabilities

## How It Should Work
1. **Runtime Environment**:
   - All Neovim runtime files should be properly located and accessible
   - Core modules like vim.diagnostic should load without errors
   - VIMRUNTIME environment variable should point to correct location

2. **User Experience**:
   - Configuration should load without errors
   - All plugins should initialize properly
   - LSP features should work seamlessly
   - Diagnostic information should be visible and accurate

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - Settings should be clearly organized in init.lua
   - Plugin management through lazy.nvim
   - Clear separation of concerns in configuration structure
