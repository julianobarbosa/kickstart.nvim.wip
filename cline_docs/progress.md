# Progress Tracking: Neovim Configuration

## What Works
1. **Core Installation**
   - Neovim 0.11.0-dev successfully installed
   - Basic configuration structure established
   - Plugin management system (lazy.nvim) initialized and working
   - Core editor functionality operational

2. **Configuration**
   - Basic editor settings configured and working
   - Keymaps defined and functional
   - Color scheme (Tokyo Night) properly applied
   - Plugin specifications defined and loading
   - Core editor functions verified working

## What's Left to Build/Fix

### High Priority
1. **Runtime Issues**
   - [ ] Fix vim.diagnostic module loading
     - Research module path configuration
     - Verify Lua runtime path settings
     - Test module loading in isolation
   - [ ] Resolve syntax.vim file location
     - Check VIMRUNTIME path configuration
     - Verify file existence in expected locations
     - Consider manual file placement if needed
   - [ ] Ensure proper VIMRUNTIME configuration
     - Document current environment settings
     - Test different configuration approaches
     - Validate against Neovim documentation

2. **Core Functionality**
   - [ ] Verify LSP server installations
     - Test each configured language server
     - Verify server startup and communication
     - Document any compatibility issues
   - [ ] Confirm diagnostic system operation
     - Test after vim.diagnostic fix
     - Verify error reporting
     - Check warning display
   - [ ] Test plugin integrations
     - Verify lazy loading behavior
     - Check plugin compatibility
     - Monitor performance impact

### Medium Priority
1. **Setup Verification**
   - [ ] Run and document :checkhealth results
     - Capture current health check output
     - Address reported issues
     - Document resolution steps
   - [ ] Test all configured keymaps
     - Verify each mapping works
     - Check for conflicts
     - Document any issues
   - [ ] Verify plugin lazy loading
     - Monitor load times
     - Check trigger conditions
     - Optimize if needed

2. **Documentation**
   - [ ] Document runtime setup process
   - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
   - [ ] Update configuration comments
   - [ ] Add performance optimization notes

## Current Status
- Configuration partially working with core features available
- Plugin system operational and properly lazy-loading
- LSP and diagnostics non-functional due to runtime issues
- Basic editor functionality fully operational
- Color scheme and UI elements working as expected

## Known Issues
1. **Critical**
   - vim.diagnostic module not found
     - Impact: Prevents LSP diagnostics
     - Possible cause: Runtime path configuration
   - Missing syntax.vim file
     - Impact: Affects syntax highlighting
     - Investigation: File location and VIMRUNTIME setting
   - Runtime path configuration issues
     - Impact: Multiple functionality gaps
     - Focus: Environment configuration review

2. **Pending Investigation**
   - Relationship between dev version and runtime files
     - Impact on standard file locations
     - Version-specific configuration needs
   - Impact on LSP functionality
     - Connection to vim.diagnostic
     - Server communication verification
   - Plugin compatibility with current setup
     - Version requirements
     - Runtime dependencies

3. **Monitoring**
   - Performance metrics
     - Current startup time: pending measurement
     - Plugin load times: to be documented
     - Memory usage: baseline needed
   - System resource utilization
     - CPU usage during operations
     - Memory growth patterns
