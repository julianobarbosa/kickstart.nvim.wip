# System Patterns: Neovim Configuration

## System Architecture
1. **Core Configuration Structure**
   - init.lua as main configuration file
   - Lazy plugin management system
   - LSP integration through nvim-lspconfig
   - Custom keymaps and settings

2. **Key Components**
   - Plugin Management (lazy.nvim)
   - LSP Configuration
   - Treesitter Integration
   - Diagnostic System
   - Custom Keybindings

## Key Technical Decisions

### Plugin Management
- Using lazy.nvim for plugin management
- Lazy loading enabled for better startup performance
- Plugin-specific configurations contained within setup blocks

### LSP Implementation
- Mason for LSP server management
- nvim-lspconfig for LSP configuration
- Custom LSP attach events and keymaps
- Diagnostic configuration through vim.diagnostic

### Editor Features
- Treesitter for syntax highlighting
- Telescope for fuzzy finding
- Which-key for keymap discovery
- Mini.nvim for various utilities

## Component Relationships
1. **Plugin Dependencies**
   - LSP plugins depend on nvim-lspconfig
   - UI elements depend on having Nerd Font
   - Telescope depends on plenary.nvim

2. **Configuration Flow**
   - Leader key set before plugins
   - Basic options configured early
   - Plugins loaded through lazy.nvim
   - LSP servers configured after plugins
   - Keymaps set after all configurations

## Design Patterns
1. **Modularity**
   - Separate plugin configurations
   - Isolated LSP server settings
   - Independent keymap definitions

2. **Event-Driven**
   - LSP attach events
   - Autocommands for specific behaviors
   - Lazy loading based on events
