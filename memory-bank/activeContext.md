## Current Session Context
[2024-02-22 16:47]

Completed initial analysis of Neovim configuration based on kickstart framework.

## Recent Changes
- Created Memory Bank structure
- Documented core configuration patterns
- Analyzed plugin configurations:
  - LSP and completion setup
  - Debugging infrastructure
  - Linting framework
  - Auto-pairs integration

## Current Goals
1. Verify tool installation and compatibility:
   - LSP servers for configured languages
   - Debug adapters
   - Linting tools

2. Review and optimize:
   - LSP configurations
   - Debug adapter configurations
   - Linting rules
   - Keymaps and shortcuts

3. Enhance documentation:
   - Plugin-specific configurations
   - Language-specific setups
   - Custom keybindings

## Open Questions
1. Are all required language servers properly configured?
2. Are there any performance bottlenecks in the current setup?
3. Should additional language support be added?
4. Are the current keymaps optimal for the workflow?
5. Would any additional plugins benefit the setup?

## Focus Areas
1. Plugin Configuration Optimization
   - Review lazy-loading strategies
   - Verify event triggers
   - Check dependency chains

2. Language Support
   - Validate LSP configurations
   - Test debugging setups
   - Verify linting rules

3. Performance Monitoring
   - Startup time
   - Memory usage
   - Plugin load times
