# Neovim Configuration Product Context

## Purpose
This Neovim configuration exists to provide a robust, efficient, and maintainable development environment using the kickstart framework as a foundation. It aims to enhance the editing experience while maintaining good performance and extensibility.

## Problems Solved
1. Complex plugin management and configuration
2. Code debugging setup and integration
3. Consistent code linting across projects
4. Efficient text editing through auto-pairing
5. Configuration organization and maintenance
6. Language server integration and management

## Expected Functionality
1. Plugin Management
   - Organized plugin configurations in separate files
   - Clear dependency management
   - Easy plugin addition and removal
   - Managed through mason.nvim for LSP servers and tools

2. Development Tools
   - Integrated debugging capabilities
   - Code linting and static analysis
   - Automatic bracket/quote pairing
   - Language server support:
     * Python (pyright, ruff-lsp)
     * Lua (lua-language-server)
     * Shell (bash-language-server)
     * Infrastructure (terraform-ls)
     * YAML (yaml-language-server)

3. Configuration Structure
   - Modular organization
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Easy maintenance and updates
   - Environment-aware setup (see systemPatterns.md)

## User Experience Goals
1. Fast and responsive editing experience
2. Intuitive plugin functionality
3. Consistent behavior across different file types
4. Clear error and diagnostic feedback
5. Smooth debugging experience
6. Integrated language intelligence:
   - Code completion
   - Go to definition
   - Symbol search
   - Inline diagnostics

## Daily Automation Procedures
1. Git Tag Creation
  - Each day's first operation should use Git Manager to create and push a git tag
  - Tag format: vYYYY.MM.DD (e.g., v2025.04.14)
  - Tag message should include the date in human-readable format
  - Purpose: Track daily development milestones and provide version reference points
