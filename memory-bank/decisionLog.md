## 2025-02-17 - Enhanced Mode State Management Architecture

### Context
The current mode management system provides basic functionality for toggling between Plan and Act modes with simple state persistence. However, as the system grows, we need a more robust and feature-rich mode management system that can handle complex state management, mode-specific behaviors, and better integration with other components.

### Decision
Implement an enhanced mode state management system with the following key components:

1. **Advanced State Management**
   - Implement mode-specific settings store
   - Add context preservation between mode switches
   - Create mode initialization hooks
   - Add state validation and recovery mechanisms

2. **Event System**
   - Implement pre/post mode change hooks
   - Add event queueing system
   - Create mode-specific event handlers
   - Support async event processing

3. **Persistence Layer**
   - Enhanced state file format with versioning
   - State migration system
   - Corruption detection and recovery
   - Mode-specific context preservation

4. **Integration System**
   - Mode-aware plugin architecture
   - LSP integration with mode context
   - Buffer and window layout persistence
   - Mode-specific UI elements

### Rationale
- Current system lacks robust state management
- Need better integration with other components
- Require more sophisticated event handling
- Want to support mode-specific behaviors
- Need better error handling and recovery
- Desire for mode-specific UI/UX customization

### Implementation
1. Phase 1: Core State Management
   - Enhance state persistence
   - Add validation system
   - Implement context preservation

2. Phase 2: Event System
   - Add event hooks
   - Implement queueing
   - Create handlers

3. Phase 3: Persistence Layer
   - Update state format
   - Add versioning
   - Implement migration

4. Phase 4: Integration
   - Plugin integration
   - LSP integration
   - UI integration

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- More robust state management
- Better error handling
- Enhanced user experience
- More flexible configuration
- Better integration capabilities

**Negative:**
- Increased complexity
- More maintenance overhead
- Larger codebase
- More potential failure points

### Status
- Decision approved
- Implementation planning in progress
- Initial architecture documented
- Ready for code mode implementation
