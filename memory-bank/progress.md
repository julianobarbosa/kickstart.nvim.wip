# Progress Update

## Current Status
Working on mode_manager plugin implementation with enhanced state management.

## Completed Tasks
1. System rollback to v0.1.0
   - Created backup branch
   - Successfully rolled back to stable version
   - Preserved previous state

2. Architecture Planning
   - Defined enhanced mode state management system
   - Documented implementation phases
   - Established integration patterns

## In Progress
1. Mode Manager Plugin Implementation:
   - Converting mode_manager.lua into proper plugin structure
   - Setting up initialization hooks
   - Implementing state persistence layer
   - Adding event system foundations

2. Integration Work:

2. Add event system with hooks and queuing
3. Implement persistence layer with versioning
4. Set up plugin and UI integration components

## Technical Requirements
- Proper plugin specification format
- Local plugin integration
- Correct module initialization
- State persistence mechanisms
- Event handling system
- Integration interfaces
