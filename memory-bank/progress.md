# Project Progress

## Completed Work
- Initial Memory Bank setup
- Basic Plan/Act mode system implementation
- Mode persistence with JSON storage
- Simple event callback system
- Status line integration
- Basic mode toggling (`<leader>tm`)

## Recent Changes
- Rolled back to v0.1.0 (commit 57f551e)
- Created backup branch of pre-rollback state

## In Progress
- Verifying system stability post-rollback
- Reassessing implementation priorities
- Evaluating core functionality

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Post-Rollback Stabilization
- [ ] Verify core functionality
- [ ] Document differences from rolled back state
- [ ] Reassess implementation priorities
- [ ] Review backup branch for salvageable improvements

### Phase 2: Core State Management
- [ ] Implement mode-specific settings store
- [ ] Add mode context preservation
- [ ] Create mode initialization hooks
- [ ] Add state validation system
- [ ] Implement error recovery mechanisms

### Phase 3: Event System Enhancement
- [ ] Add pre-mode-change hooks
- [ ] Implement post-mode-change hooks
- [ ] Create event queueing system
- [ ] Add mode-specific event handlers
- [ ] Implement async event processing

### Phase 4: Integration Features
- [ ] Add mode-specific colorschemes
- [ ] Implement mode-specific keymaps
- [ ] Create mode-specific status line content
- [ ] Add mode-specific buffer handling
- [ ] Implement window layout persistence

## Known Issues
- Current state persistence is basic
- No validation of stored state
- Limited error recovery options
- No mode-specific settings
- Basic event handling system

## Future Considerations
- Custom mode creation system
- Mode-specific plugin configurations
- Advanced state synchronization
- Mode templates and presets
- Mode groups
- Mode transitions animations
- Mode-specific help system
