## Current Session Context
[2025-03-24 19:51] - LSP Configuration and Testing

Created dedicated LSP configuration file and prepared for server testing.

## Recent Changes
- Created new LSP configuration file (lua/custom/plugins/lsp.lua)
- Configured Mason with automatic installation
- Set up LSP servers for multiple languages
- Added UI configuration for Mason
- Configured completion capabilities

## Current Goals
1. Next immediate steps:
   - Test Mason initialization
   - Verify LSP server installations
   - Test each configured language server
   - Validate completion setup

2. Implementation priorities:
   - [ ] Test lua_ls for configuration files
   - [ ] Verify pyright for Python development
   - [ ] Check terraform-ls setup
   - [ ] Validate yaml and ansible support

## Open Questions
1. Is Mason properly initialized during startup?
2. Are all required LSP servers installed correctly?
3. Do we need additional language servers?
4. Should we add more language-specific settings?

## Focus Areas
1. LSP Configuration
   - Server installation process
   - Configuration validation
   - Completion integration

2. Testing
   - Server initialization
   - Language support
   - Diagnostic features
