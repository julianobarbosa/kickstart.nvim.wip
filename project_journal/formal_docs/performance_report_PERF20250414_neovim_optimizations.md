# Performance Optimization Report - Neovim Configuration
Date: 2025-04-14

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Startup Sequence Optimization
- Implemented runtime path caching to reduce filesystem operations
- Deferred non-critical directory creation to VimEnter event
- Delayed clipboard synchronization to first buffer load
- Cached plugin specifications with TTL-based invalidation

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduced initial startup time by minimizing filesystem operations
- Decreased memory usage during startup phase
- More responsive editor initialization

### 2. LSP Configuration Improvements
- Implemented progressive loading based on file types
- Added prioritized completion sources with resource limits:
  * LSP (priority 1000)
  * Snippets (priority 800)
  * Buffer (priority 500, limited to 10 items)
  * Path (priority 250)
- Added memory limits and resource controls:
  * Maximum file preload: 5000 files
  * Maximum preload file size: 1000KB
  * Debounce time: 150ms
  * Throttling: 50ms

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduced memory usage by LSP servers
- More responsive completion
- Better resource utilization

### 3. Plugin Management Enhancements
- Implemented priority-based plugin loading:
  * Core editor features (priority 100)
  * UI components (priority 50)
  * LSP features (priority 25)
  * Additional tools (priority 0)
- Enhanced lazy.nvim cache configuration:
  * 24-hour TTL for cache
  * Optimized cache invalidation checks
  * Streamlined RTP paths

**Expected Impact:**
- Faster plugin initialization
- Reduced startup overhead
- Better resource allocation

## Implementation Details

### Filesystem Operations
```lua
-- Runtime path caching
local rtp_cache_file = vim.fn.stdpath('cache') .. '/rtp_cache.lua'
```

### LSP Progressive Loading
```lua
-- File type-specific LSP loading
event = {
  'BufReadPre *.lua',
  'BufReadPre *.py',
  'BufReadPre *.js',
  -- ...
}
```

### Resource Limits
```lua
-- LSP server limits
workspace = {
  maxPreload = 5000,
  preloadFileSize = 1000,
}
```

## Performance Metrics

### Startup Time Impact
- Initial startup: Expected 20-30% reduction
- LSP initialization: Expected 40-50% reduction
- Plugin loading: Expected 25-35% reduction

### Memory Usage
- LSP servers: Expected 30-40% reduction
- Plugin overhead: Expected 20-25% reduction
- Completion cache: Expected 40-50% reduction

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. Track startup time:
```lua
vim.defer_fn(function()
  vim.notify(string.format('Startup Time: %sms', vim.g.startup_time))
end, 0)
```

2. Monitor LSP memory usage:
```lua
vim.lsp.handlers['workspace/diagnostic/refresh'] = function()
  collectgarbage('collect')
end
```

3. Plugin loading metrics:
- Implement hooks in lazy.nvim for load time tracking
- Monitor cache hit rates

## Security Considerations

All optimizations maintain existing security controls:
- LSP server validation
- Checksum verification
- Restricted module loading
- Third-party package verification

## Next Steps

1. Monitor actual performance metrics
2. Fine-tune resource limits based on usage patterns
3. Implement automated performance regression tests
4. Add telemetry for long-term optimization
