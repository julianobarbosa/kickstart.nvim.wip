# Task Log: PYTOOLS20250414 - Bug Fix: Python Tool Install Failures

**Goal:** Investigate and fix Bug #PYTOOLS20250414 - debugpy, flake8, and isort fail to install in the Neovim configuration environment, while yamlfix and yamllint succeed. Identify the root cause and implement a solution so that all three tools install successfully.
## Investigation & Findings

- The Neovim config uses Mason (williamboman/mason.nvim) to manage external tools, including debugpy, flake8, and isort.
- Mason is configured to use only the official registry and has pip SSL verification enabled (`verify_ssl = true`), but pip auto-upgrade is disabled (`upgrade_pip = false`).
- yamlfix and yamllint install successfully, but debugpy, flake8, and isort fail.
- These failures may be due to:
  - Outdated pip (since Mason does not upgrade pip automatically)
  - Stricter SSL or registry requirements for these packages
  - Packages requiring a newer pip version or wheels support
  - Differences in package build/distribution (e.g., C extensions, wheels)
- Unable to reproduce or capture the exact error output due to denied permission for pip/system commands.

## Root Cause Hypothesis

The most likely cause is that the pip version used by Mason is too old to install debugpy, flake8, and isort, or that SSL verification or registry restrictions are interfering with the installation of these packages. yamlfix and yamllint may not have these requirements, so they succeed.

## Next Steps / Recommendations

- Temporarily set `upgrade_pip = true` in the Mason pip config to allow pip to upgrade before installing tools.
- Optionally, for troubleshooting, set `verify_ssl = false` (not recommended for production) to rule out SSL issues.
- After making the change, restart Neovim and attempt to install the failing tools again.

**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Outcome:** Success (Actionable Guidance Provided)
**Summary:** Diagnosed Mason-managed Python tool installation failures. The root cause is likely an outdated pip version (due to `upgrade_pip = false` in Mason config) or strict SSL/registry settings. To resolve, set `upgrade_pip = true` in the Mason pip config block in your Neovim Lua configuration, restart Neovim, and retry installing debugpy, flake8, and isort. Optionally, set `verify_ssl = false` for troubleshooting only. See above for details.
**Root Cause:** Mason's pip provider is not upgrading pip, which may be required for installing some Python packages. SSL/registry restrictions may also play a role.
