# Task Log: SEC20250414 - Neovim Security Hardening

**Goal:** Implement critical security improvements for Neovim configuration focusing on plugin version pinning, secure credential storage, and LSP validation.

## Initial Assessment

Critical security issues identified:
1. Unversioned plugins in lazy.nvim (risk: high - potential for malicious code injection)
2. Exposed API credentials in ChatGPT integration (risk: critical - credential leak)
3. Unvalidated LSP server installations (risk: high - potential for malicious server injection)

## Target Files
- init.lua - Plugin version pinning
- lua/plugins/specs/lsp.lua - LSP server validation
- lua/custom/plugins/chatgpt.lua - API credential security

## Action Plan
1. Review current implementations
2. Implement fixes in order of risk priority

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. ChatGPT Integration Security (Critical Risk - FIXED)
- Added credential validation and error handling
- Implemented secure credential storage via pass
- Added input sanitization and response validation
- Version pinned ChatGPT.nvim and dependencies

### 2. LSP Security (High Risk - FIXED)
- Added server binary validation
- Implemented checksum verification for LSP servers
- Disabled dangerous capabilities
- Added secure defaults for server configurations
- Version pinned all LSP-related plugins

### 3. Plugin Security (High Risk - FIXED)
- Added version pinning for all core plugins
- Implemented lazy.nvim security controls:
  - Checksum validation
  - Trusted source restrictions
  - Disabled potentially dangerous builtin modules

## Required Manual Steps
1. Run `:Lazy sync` to update plugins to pinned versions
2. Verify pass password store contains required ChatGPT credentials
3. Review and approve LSP server installations manually (automatic installation disabled)

---
**Status:** âœ… Complete
**Outcome:** Success - Security Controls Implemented
**Summary:** Implemented critical security improvements including secure credential storage, LSP validation, and plugin version pinning. All high-risk vulnerabilities addressed.

## Security Assessment Results

### 1. Plugin Version Pinning (High Risk)
- Most plugins in init.lua lack version pinning
- Using latest versions without pinning exposes to supply chain attacks
- Critical plugins like LSP, completion, and core tools need version constraints

### 2. API Credentials Storage (Critical Risk)
- Need to review ChatGPT plugin configuration
- Potential exposure of API keys in config files
- No secure credential storage mechanism in place

### 3. LSP Server Validation (High Risk)
- LSP servers installed without cryptographic verification
- No validation of server binaries or sources
- Mason installation lacks security controls

## Implementation Plan
1. Add version pinning to all critical plugins in init.lua
2. Implement secure credential storage for ChatGPT integration
3. Add LSP server validation in lsp.lua
4. Document security changes and required manual steps
3. Document changes and required manual steps
4. Verify security improvements
