# Task Coordination Log: Mason Python Tool Installation Bug

**Delegation:** Task assigned to Bug Fixer specialist via MDTM (see TASK-BUG-FIXER-20250418-143220.md) due to technical nature of Python tool installation and Mason config troubleshooting.

**Reasoning:** Bug Fixer mode was chosen for its expertise in diagnosing and resolving environment/configuration issues affecting developer tooling.

**Outcome:** Bug Fixer resolved the issue by removing custom pip install_args from `lua/custom/plugins/lsp.lua`, restoring Mason's default Python venv handling. All required tools now install successfully. Task log and code changes are documented in the MDTM file.
